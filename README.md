n8n Multi-Agent Workflow (AI Agents with OpenAI)
This project is a practical implementation of a multi-agent automation system built using n8n and OpenAI Agents.
It showcases how multiple AI agents can collaborate, pass context, and complete tasks autonomously inside a workflow.
✨ What This Workflow Does


Uses multiple AI agents with defined roles


Shares memory and context between agents


Demonstrates decision-making and task delegation


Runs fully automated inside n8n


Uses OpenAI AgentKit functions inside agent prompts


Clean, modular design for real-world automation


🎯 Why I Built This
This is my third automation project after:


Airtable automation workflow


Google Sheets AI Agent
Now, I wanted to explore multi-agent collaboration — an important skill for advanced automation and Agentic AI.
