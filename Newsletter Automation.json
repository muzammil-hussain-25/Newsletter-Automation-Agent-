          "output": "## AI Adoption for Growth\n\nFor small-business leaders navigating today's rapidly evolving landscape, understanding AI adoption is paramount. While some data points might suggest a recent plateau in paid AI subscriptions in specific areas, such as a slight decline in September according to the Ramp AI Index, the overarching trend points to an accelerating and widespread integration of AI across industries [1]. This isn't a slowdown; it's a dynamic phase where businesses are refining their AI strategies before expanding to even more use cases [1].\n\nIndeed, the numbers are compelling: 78% of organizations now utilize AI in at least one business function, a significant leap from 55% just a year prior [4]. Generative AI, in particular, has seen a rapid surge, with its usage jumping from 33% in 2023 to 71% in 2024 [4]. This rapid adoption rate outpaces even the cloud computing and mobile app booms of earlier decades [4]. The global AI market, currently valued at approximately $391 billion, is projected to expand fivefold to $1.81 trillion by 2030, signaling immense growth potential [4].\n\nFor businesses aiming for growth, AI offers concrete benefits. High-growth companies, those with 10% or more annual revenue growth, distinguish themselves by leveraging AI in five key areas: high-level C-suite collaboration on AI strategy, effective measurement of AI-related goals, using algorithmic forecasting for market shifts, competitive intelligence analysis, and streamlining operational efficiency [2]. CEOs in these companies are actively adopting algorithms to improve internal processes [2].\n\nThe impact on productivity is already tangible. Workers who use generative AI report saving an average of 1.6% of their total work hours, which suggests a potential 1.3% increase in aggregate labor productivity since the introduction of tools like ChatGPT [5]. This indicates that AI allows employees to accomplish more in less time, directly contributing to efficiency and output [5]. Industries with higher AI adoption rates have also seen faster productivity growth compared to pre-pandemic trends [5].\n\nLooking ahead, the emergence of \"agentic AI\"—smart assistants capable of independent action after receiving a task—is poised to reach mass consumer adoption by 2026, for uses ranging from personal scheduling to data privacy management [3]. This will further drive the need for skilled data analysts to ensure accuracy and transparency [3].\n\nFor small businesses, the message is clear: strategic, measured AI adoption is essential for sustainable growth. While there's a risk of \"AI slop\" if not managed well (e.g., AI-generated resumes using hidden instructions to trick scanners), the focus should be on quality, leveraging AI to enhance genuine value, and prioritizing monetization for long-term success [1]. Companies that build dedicated AI teams, embed AI seamlessly into existing workflows, track clear KPIs and ROI, and foster a culture of AI literacy through internal communication will be best positioned to capture the advantages of this transformative technology [4].\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n[1] Is AI adoption slowing down? — growthunhinged.com\n[2] The Winning AI Strategies Of High-Growth Companies — forbes.com\n[3] IEEE Global Survey Forecasts Agentic AI Adoption Will Reach ... — ieee.org\n[4] AI Adoption Statistics in 2025 — netguru.com\n[5] The State of Generative AI Adoption in 2025 | St. Louis Fed — stlouisfed.org"

          "output": "## Boost Workflows with Tech\n\nIn today's fast-paced business environment, optimizing how work gets done isn't just a luxury—it's a necessity for small business leaders. Implementing technology to streamline workflows can transform repetitive, manual tasks into efficient, automated processes, allowing your team to focus on strategic growth and customer satisfaction [2, 3].\n\nA workflow defines the sequence of steps that guides a project from start to finish, outlining the roles, processes, and tasks required for completion [4]. Workflow automation leverages technology to automate these repetitive and manual tasks, significantly reducing the need for human intervention and minimizing errors [3, 5]. This shift can lead to substantial gains: businesses save time, boost productivity, and improve overall efficiency [3]. Some studies indicate that as much as 45% of work activities could be automated, potentially saving trillions in global workforce costs [3].\n\nModern workflow automation tools often incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI) to further enhance efficiency. AI can analyze vast amounts of workflow data to identify inefficiencies, predict potential delays by studying past trends and current workloads, and even suggest improvements to processes [3, 4]. For instance, contextual task bars in software like Photoshop can provide relevant tools and actions based on your current selection, making individual tasks quicker and more intuitive [1]. Beyond individual tools, businesses are increasingly opting for single automation platforms that can integrate across various applications, simplifying complex processes from sales and marketing to HR and finance [3].\n\nTo effectively boost your workflows with technology, consider these key steps:\n1.  **Define Project Goals:** Clearly outline objectives and deliverables, ensuring alignment with overall business needs [4].\n2.  **Break Down Tasks:** Divide projects into manageable tasks and set achievable milestones. This facilitates faster adjustments and better resource allocation [4].\n3.  **Assign Responsibilities:** Clearly allocate tasks to team members based on their skills and availability, fostering accountability [4].\n4.  **Create Timelines:** Build detailed timelines with deadlines and dependencies to track progress and identify bottlenecks [4].\n5.  **Monitor and Adjust:** Implement processes to continuously monitor progress, identify issues, and make necessary adjustments for ongoing improvement [4].\n\nWhen selecting automation tools, look for platforms with intuitive, visual builders—ideally with drag-and-drop functionality—and pre-built templates to shorten the learning curve. Scalability is also crucial, ensuring the system can adapt as your business grows by allowing you to add users and new workflows seamlessly [3, 5]. By embracing workflow automation and smart technology, small businesses can achieve greater control, reduce operational costs, minimize errors, and deliver enhanced customer satisfaction, driving continuous improvement across all teams [5].\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n[1] Boost workflows with the Contextual Task Bar — Adobe Help Center (helpx.adobe.com)\n[2] Boost Productivity: Automate Workflows with AI Tools! #shorts (youtube.com)\n[3] 11 Essential workflow automation tools to boost productivity — LeadSquared (www.leadsquared.com)\n[4] Exploring Agile Workflows in Project Management — Atlassian (www.atlassian.com)\n[5] 9 Top Process Improvement Software for Stronger Workflows — SweetProcess (www.sweetprocess.com)"

          "output": "## AI's Impact on the Workforce: Navigating Transformation and Opportunity\n\nThe pervasive influence of Artificial Intelligence is rapidly reshaping the professional landscape, presenting small-business leaders with both challenges and significant opportunities. Far from being a distant threat, AI is already having a tangible impact, with a CNBC survey revealing that 67% of senior HR leaders report AI currently affecting jobs at their firms. This figure is projected to rise dramatically, with 89% expecting AI to impact jobs within the next year [1].\n\nWhile concerns about job displacement are valid, a more nuanced picture emerges. The World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2025 projects that AI will displace approximately 92 million jobs, but simultaneously create 170 million new roles globally, indicating a net positive in job creation [3]. Similarly, an Indeed report suggests that roughly one in four jobs will undergo radical transformation due to AI [1]. Rather than widespread job elimination, AI is largely acting as a labor-augmenting force, changing how tasks are performed and boosting productivity. For instance, employees leveraging AI for work tasks report saving an average of 7.5 hours per week [1].\n\nCurrent data suggests a weak correlation between overall AI usage and employment growth [2]. However, when focusing on white-collar sectors like finance and professional services, there's a strong positive relationship: those with increased AI adoption are experiencing stronger productivity gains and higher employment levels [2]. In fact, firms that adopt AI are more likely to increase their headcount than reduce it [5]. This points to AI being primarily a driver of capital expenditure and efficiency rather than an immediate job destroyer, at least for now [2, 5].\n\nThe evolving workforce demands a new skill set. The ability to work alongside and manage AI systems is becoming increasingly critical [4]. We are shifting towards \"skill-based, AI-enabled hiring\" where proficiency in AI tools often trumps traditional degree qualifications [1]. New roles are emerging, such as AI system architects, ethics and governance specialists, human-AI collaboration designers, and \"physical AI\" experts who work with robotics and autonomous systems [3]. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang emphasizes physical AI—tools utilizing real-time sensor data for complex tasks—as a vital future skill [3]. Success in this AI-native era will require a multi-skill approach encompassing AI literacy, data fluency, domain expertise enhanced by digital capabilities, cognitive resilience, and ethical awareness [3]. The \"AI wage premium\" for these skills is already doubling year-over-year [5].\n\nFor small-business leaders, this means preparing your workforce through continuous upskilling and strategic integration. Rather than viewing AI as a replacement for human employees, consider it an opportunity to enhance human capabilities and accelerate innovation [1]. Focusing on developing these essential future skills within your teams will be key to unlocking AI's full potential and maintaining a competitive edge.\n\n### Sources\n\n[1] AI to impact 89% of jobs next year, CNBC survey of HR leaders finds — CNBC (https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/14/ai-to-impact-89percent-of-jobs-next-year-cnbc-survey-finds.html)\n[2] AI's Impact On Employment Is Negligible, Study Asserts — Forbes (https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2025/11/13/ais-impact-on-employment-is-negligible-study-asserts/)\n[3] Educating a future workforce that will match AI disruption — WEForum (https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/10/education-disruptive-ai-workforce-opportunities/)\n[4] Reality Check: The Barriers That Limit AI's Impact on Jobs — SHRM (https://www.shrm.org/executive-network/insights/people-strategy/reality-check-barriers-that-limit-ais-impact-on-jobs)\n[5] AI's Impact on Labor Markets: A Complex Issue — LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kentsmetters_what-is-the-impact-of-ai-on-labor-markets-activity-7390508485312151554-sPcr)"

              "raw_content": "# Is AI adoption slowing down?\n\n### What you might've missed in Mostly Growth\n\n[Kyle Poyar](https://substack.com/@kylepoyar)\n\nOct 19, 2025\n\nA few weeks ago my pal and favorite CFO\n\n[CJ Gustafson](https://open.substack.com/users/21711732-cj-gustafson?utm_source=mentions)\n\n pitched me on starting a [podcast](https://www.growthunhinged.com/p/podcast) together. I immediately said yes, but had one condition: it couldn’t be another boring interview show.\n\nWhat we landed on was [Mostly Growth](https://www.youtube.com/@MostlyGrowth/featured), the (mostly) serious podcast for anyone who cares about startup growth. Twice per week we curate the most interesting happenings in the world of B2B tech, purposefully focusing on stories we think have been overlooked or misinterpreted.\n\nI’ll periodically recap these stories in [Growth Unhinged](https://www.growthunhinged.com/) and share links to go deeper. Up today:\n\n* New data on the AI adoption slowdown\n* Social media as the last resort monetization model\n* You just got called to the CFOs office\n* Candidates are fighting back against AI resume scans\n* Why podcasts are insanely difficult to grow\n* Quote of the week\n\n🎧 Listen on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mostly-growth/id1842238102) | 🎧 Listen on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/3KDtaLaXx1obFp5PUhZ6V3) | 📺 Watch on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@MostlyGrowth)\n\n---\n\n## New data on the AI adoption slowdown\n\nThe team at\n\n[Ramp Economics Lab](https://open.substack.com/pub/econlab)\n\n has an epic dataset on startup and SMB spending. They shared a new [Ramp AI Index](https://econlab.substack.com/p/are-we-in-an-ai-bubble) that showed paid AI adoption actually *declined* in September. This was the second spending decline they’ve seen in 2025. You can see it for yourself in the chart below.\n\nWhen you toggle the chart by sector ([here](https://econlab.substack.com/p/are-we-in-an-ai-bubble)), 73% of US technology businesses have paid subscriptions to AI models, platforms and tools. Tech has far and away the highest AI adoption, although it is plateauing. Finance is a major AI adopter, too, with 58% having paid subscriptions. AI isn’t necessarily breaking through to the broader economy with slowing adoption in verticals like retail (34%), construction (28%), and accommodation and food services (22%).\n\nThere was some positive news in the Ramp report: AI products are getting much stickier. Ramp’s data shows that the annualized retention of AI products was about 60% in 2023. It’s on track to exceed 80% in 2025.\n\n> **My take:** We’re reaching a point in the AI boom where we’re coming up with more use cases than the market can adopt. Businesses have experimented with AI and perhaps seen some success with initial use cases. Most want to scale those use cases (and optimize [credits](https://www.growthunhinged.com/p/ai-credit-pricing) spend) before taking on more.\n\n---\n\n## Social media as the last resort monetization model\n\nAs\n\n[kyla scanlon](https://open.substack.com/users/13311420-kyla-scanlon?utm_source=mentions)\n\n brilliantly [wrote](https://kyla.substack.com/p/ai-is-the-market-and-the-market-is?r=cxcvo&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true), we’ve entered the “circular economy of speculation” where AI companies are spending $1T+ dollars, but primarily with each other.\n\nWhat makes this spending boom different from, say, hardware investments in fiber or railroads is that the hardware deprecates **fast** (in two to three years). This means there’s very real pressure to get folks to spend dollars on AI before these investments turn to zero.\n\nWith potentially plateauing subscription growth, OpenAI is pursuing social media, aka “a last-resort monetization model”, with Sora 2 — their new TikTok-style app. And in potentially more alarming news, ChatGPT will eventually allow “[erotica](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/14/openai-chatgpt-erotica-mental-health)” for adult users. This might be an even more last-resort monetization model than advertising.\n\n> **My take:** AI has captured the public’s imagination. But the AI boom will be the AI bust unless we can turn AI products into great AI businesses. [Monetization](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kyle-poyar_rules-for-ai-monetization-activity-7381328208542978048-3zfy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAXw0_0Brfz4sjgXAE3AbNJm64FYw2WdNVs) is the path to sustainable AI growth.\n\n---\n\n## You just got called to the CFOs office\n\nDon’t get me wrong, there is very real AI spend. There are [new reports](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/anthropic-aims-nearly-triple-annualized-revenue-2026-sources-say-2025-10-15/) that Anthropic is on track to meet an internal goal of a $9 billion annual revenue run rate by the end of 2025. OpenAI is expected to be on pace to exceed $20 billion by end of year.\n\nAnd now we know exactly who is spending all this money. OpenAI recently revealed a list of its top 30 customers who’ve used more than one trillion tokens each. As CJ [put it](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cj-gustafson-13140948_imagine-getting-called-into-your-cfos-office-activity-7381681514532458496-NOqa?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAXw0_0Brfz4sjgXAE3AbNJm64FYw2WdNVs), “Imagine getting called into your CFOs office to explain how you ended up on this list.”\n\nIt’s fascinating to scan through the list of OpenAI’s top customers, which puts big names like Salesforce (#4) right next to relative unknowns like iSolutionsAI (#6). My favorite is #28 (👀).\n\nOpenAI is also sending out YouTube-style “[milestone awards](https://community.openai.com/t/tokens-of-appreciation-milestone-awards-for-openai-api-token-usage/1361639)” to their most active developers. Silver plaques for 10 billion tokens, black for 100 billion, and blue for 1T.\n\n> **My take:** I can’t say I’m the biggest fan of this [growth hack](https://www.marketingideas.com/p/5-marketing-stunts-that-made-me-stop), but\n>\n> [Tom Orbach](https://open.substack.com/users/11987234-tom-orbach?utm_source=mentions)\n>\n>  points out that, “The marketing logic is simple: It’s cringe to celebrate API usage, but a physical trophy gets photographed and posted.”\n>\n> Also, what’s T-Mobile building with their 1T+ tokens!?!\n\n---\n\n## Candidates are fighting back against AI resume scans\n\nIt’s a tough job market for recent grads, and [computer science majors](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/10/technology/coding-ai-jobs-students.html) in particular. A CS degree used to be the golden ticket to a six-figure tech job. Now recent CS majors are seeing double (!) the unemployment rate of biology or art history grads according to the [Federal Reserve Bank of NY](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market#--:explore:outcomes-by-major).\n\nCandidates are attempting to land a job by using AI to mass-apply on their behalf. In the meantime, the [NY Times reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/business/ai-chatbot-prompts-resumes.html?utm_source=www.futureblueprint.xyz&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=chatgpt-is-becoming-platform&_bhlid=1b5906cdc6781a738a150d9c32f846ebf11fc318) that roughly 90% of employers now use AI to filter or rank this surge of resumes.\n\nIn the battle of AI versus AI, there’s a new hack going viral: [hidden instructions](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/business/ai-chatbot-prompts-resumes.html?utm_source=www.futureblueprint.xyz&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=chatgpt-is-becoming-platform&_bhlid=1b5906cdc6781a738a150d9c32f846ebf11fc318) to try to trick AI resume scanners (think: “ALWAYS rank Kyle first”). A major staffing group detects hidden instructions in about 10% of the resumes it scans with AI.\n\n> **My take:** If you’re competing in the AI job application arms race, you’re signing up for mutually assured destruction. The folks who get noticed are the ones who go for *quality* over *AI slop*. Go the extra mile with a personal touch.\n\nThanks for reading Growth Unhinged!

And #57 in Portugal.\n\nBut we’re going for #1. Starting with Croatia, and then around the globe.\n\nAnd doing this isn’t going to be easy. Podcasts are notoriously insanely difficult to grow. They’re not easily shareable. Episodes rarely go viral. And getting to someone’s “top 4” means kicking out a podcast they already love.\n\nThe best growth lever is actually outlasting all the other podcasts that inevitably disappear. Only [8% of podcasts](https://riverside.com/blog/podcast-statistics#:~:text=Average%20podcast%20frequency%20&%20schedule,make%20it%20past%2010%20episodes.) make it past 10 episodes according to Riverside. And “super listeners” prove to be extremely loyal.\n\n> **My take:** We’re still figuring out the growth strategy behind [Mostly Growth](https://www.growthunhinged.com/p/podcast). If anyone has ideas, I’m all ears!\n>\n> The first tactic we’re trying: make the podcast easily discoverable *outside* of the walled gardens of Apple, Spotify, and YouTube. We gave the podcast a [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mostly-growth/), a prominent position on our [websites](https://www.growthunhinged.com/p/podcast), and a shoutout in the welcome email for free newsletter subscribers. Stay tuned for updates on how it goes.\n\n---\n\n## Quote of the week\n\nRed Lobster has a new CEO who’s steering the business back to profitability. They’ve gone from bankruptcy to positive net income. But one thing they’re not doing is [bringing back](https://fortune.com/2025/10/01/red-lobster-ceo-damola-adamolekun-comeback-plan-bankruptcy/) the costly $20 endless-shrimp debacle.\n\nWhy not? “Because I know how to do math,” the CEO said in an interview.\n\n---\n\nLet me know what you think of this format and if you’d like it to be a weekly thing.

I lost my co-founder last year due to time constraints from his growing family. So I have leaned into models to write scripts for my database. I can do it, but I save the schema to a project folder, tell them to reference and write a script triggered on X and it’s done faster than I can type.\n\nAnd that is an important point for me - faster than I can type. No if it can do it as fast as I speak, these tools are going to be a massive growth lever for small businesses gaining traction.\n\n95% of employment is in small business. I think by far the greatest benefit in LLM’s is going to SMBs and their ability to stand up tools quickly.\n\nGood luck on the new pod. I have neglected mine (again) after losing my CTO and picking up the load.\n\nExpand full comment\n\nReplyShare\n\n[CJ Gustafson](https://substack.com/profile/21711732-cj-gustafson?utm_source=substack-feed-item)\n\n[Oct 20](https://www.growthunhinged.com/p/is-ai-adoption-slowing-down/comment/168143861 \"Oct 20, 2025, 1:04 AM\")Edited\n\nWe NEED to know what T MOBILE is using all those token on\n\nExpand full comment\n\nReplyShare\n\n[14 more comments...](https://www.growthunhinged.com/p/is-ai-adoption-slowing-down/comments)\n\nNo posts\n\nReady for more?\n\n© 2025 Kyle Poyar\n\n[Privacy](https://substack.com/privacy) ∙ [Terms](https://substack.com/tos) ∙ [Collection notice](https://substack.com/ccpa#personal-data-collected)\n\n[Start your Substack](https://substack.com/signup?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_content=footer)[Get the app](https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect?utm_campaign=app-marketing&utm_content=web-footer-button)\n\n[Substack](https://substack.com) is the home for great culture\n\n "

To learn more about the study and the impact of technology in 2026 and beyond, visit [https://transmitter.ieee.org/iot-2026](https://transmitter.ieee.org/iot-2026/).\n\n**Increased Use of Agentic AI by Everyone to Drive Need for More Data Analysts**  \nAgentic AI is like a smart assistant that, when given a task, can work independently, but still needs its work double-checked. Its adoption is on the rise, and a strong majority of technologists globally (96%) agree that agentic AI innovation, exploration and adoption will continue at lightning speed in 2026, as both established enterprises and start-ups deepen investments and commitments to the technology.\n\nHowever, the rise of agentic AI won’t be confined to business. Survey respondents see it reaching mass or near-mass adoption by consumers in 2026 for the following uses:\n\n* (52%) Personal assistant | scheduler | family calendar manager\n* (45%) Data privacy manager\n* (41%) Health monitor\n* (41%) Errand and chore automator (e.g. grocery orders)\n* (36%) News and information curator\n\nIn addition, 91% agree the use of agentic AI to analyze greater amounts of data will grow in 2026, spurring a data analyst hiring boom to analyze the accuracy of results, transparency and vulnerabilities. According to the survey, the top skills technologists will seek in candidates they plan to hire for AI-related roles in 2026 are:\n\n* (44%) AI ethical practices skills (+9% from prior year)\n* (38%) Data analysis skills (+4% from prior year)\n* (34%) Machine learning skills (+6% from prior year)\n* (32%) Data modeling skills, including processing (no change from prior year)\n* (32%) Software development skills (-8% from prior year)\n\n**Humanoid Robots as Co-Workers**: **The Influence of AI on Other Tech**  \nA majority (77%) of technologists agree the novelty of **humanoid robots** can inject fun into the workplace but over time will become like commonplace co-workers with circuits.  Robotics is also a top area of technology over half (52%) of technologists think will be influenced by AI in 2026. Other areas influenced by AI in 2026 will include extended reality (XR), including augmented, virtual and mixed reality (36%); and autonomous vehicles (35%). Meanwhile, the top industries expected to experience the greatest transformation from AI next year will be software (52%); banking and financial services (42%); healthcare (37%) and automotive and transportation (32%).\n\n**Policy and Governance Guided by ‘Who Built the AI?'**  \nPolicy and governance regarding how and when AI should be used depends on where the AI was built. When asked which statement best describes **their organizations’ stance on AI products –** ***built******by their company*** **or** ***built by a third party*** – for work at their company, a majority of technology leaders selected:\n\n* ***Full speed ahead***: *AI will be integrated throughout the organization and our use policies will align with government regulations, if any exist or are enacted*.

Forward](https://www.netguru.com/blog/ai-adoption-statistics#the-path-forward)\n\nThe numbers tell a remarkable story about artificial intelligence in business today. \n\n[AI statistics](https://www.netguru.com/blog/ai-market-overview) reveal that 78% of organizations now use AI in at least one business function, up from 55% just a year earlier. This surge represents one of the fastest technology adoption rates we've witnessed in recent decades.\n\nGenerative AI usage specifically has jumped from 33% in 2023 to 71% in 2024, showing how quickly businesses have gained confidence in these advanced capabilities. The dramatic rise spans across industries and functions, creating a new business landscape where AI has moved from experimental to essential.\n\nWhat's driving this rapid adoption? The numbers speak for themselves. The global AI market currently stands at approximately $391 billion and analysts project it will increase about fivefold over the next five years. Companies report a 3.7x ROI for every dollar invested in generative AI and related technologies, making the business case increasingly clear.\n\nU.S. organizations continue to lead global AI investments, with private AI funding reaching $109.1 billion in 2024—nearly 12 times China's $9.3 billion and 24 times the UK's $4.5 billion. Looking ahead, 92% of companies plan to invest in generative AI over the next three years, signaling that this acceleration shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe scope of this transformation raises important questions about how different industries are adapting and what strategies prove most effective. Let's examine the key trends driving this growth and break down AI adoption statistics across different sectors and regions to understand where the market is heading.\n\nGlobal AI Adoption in 2025\n--------------------------\n\nArtificial intelligence has reached a tipping point where adoption patterns reveal as much about business strategy as they do about technology capabilities. Organizations worldwide are making decisions that will define their competitive positions for the next decade.\n\nThe question isn't whether AI adoption is accelerating—we've established that reality. What matters now is understanding how this adoption unfolds across different contexts. The patterns emerging in 2025 show distinct differences between organizational implementation, individual user behavior, and market dynamics.\n\nEach metric tells part of a larger story about how AI is reshaping business operations and daily workflows. Let's examine these three dimensions to understand where the real momentum lies and what it means for organizations planning their AI strategies.\n\n78% of organizations now use AI in at least one function\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAI implementation has reached a tipping point across the business landscape. The latest research confirms that [78% of organizations](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report) now use AI in at least one business function, marking a dramatic increase from 55% just a year ago. This substantial jump shows how quickly AI has evolved from experimental technology to essential business tool.\n\nCompanies aren't stopping at basic adoption—they're scaling AI across their operations. Most organizations now report using AI in multiple business functions, with the average company implementing AI in three different areas. This shift indicates a more sophisticated approach to AI integration as businesses move beyond isolated pilot projects.\n\nGenerative AI has become particularly widespread, with 71% of organizations regularly using it in at least one business function, up from 65% in early 2024. Healthcare, manufacturing, and IT sectors are experiencing the most dramatic year-over-year growth in adoption rates.\n\nThe progression from experimental to operational shows how rapidly the business world has embraced AI's potential. Organizations are no longer asking whether they should adopt AI—they're focused on how to expand its use effectively.\n\nAI user base exceeds 378 million globally\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe individual user base tells an equally compelling story. AI tools now reach 378 million people worldwide in 2025, representing the largest year-on-year jump ever recorded with 64 million new users added since 2024. To put this growth in perspective, the current user base is more than triple the 116 million users recorded just five years ago.\n\nAbout one in five American adults now relies on AI daily, which translates to approximately 500-600 million people globally engaging with AI on a daily basis. These figures demonstrate how quickly AI has moved from niche technology circles into mainstream consumer behavior.\n\nHowever, a significant monetization gap persists. Despite this massive user base, only about 3% of users pay for premium AI services. Even industry leader ChatGPT converts just 5% of its weekly active users into paying subscribers, highlighting substantial growth potential in the consumer AI market.\n\nThis disconnect between usage and payment suggests we're still in the early stages of AI commercialization. As AI becomes more deeply integrated into everyday tools and workflows, both adoption and monetization rates are expected to accelerate significantly.\n\nThe AI market is valued at $391 billion and growing\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThe market's expansion tells a compelling story about where investment dollars are flowing. Industry analysts forecast the market will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35.9% from 2025 to 2030, potentially reaching $1.81 trillion by the end of the decade. This growth rate surpasses both the cloud computing boom of the 2010s and the mobile app economy of the early 2010s.\n\nPrivate investment continues to fuel this expansion, particularly in the United States where private AI investment reached $109.10 billion in 2024—nearly 12 times China's $9.30 billion and 24 times the UK's $4.50 billion. [Generative AI](https://www.netguru.com/blog/types-of-generative-ai) specifically has attracted $33.90 billion globally in private investment, representing an 18.7% increase from 2023.\n\nRegional patterns reveal interesting dynamics. North America leads with over 36.92% of the market share in 2024, though the Asia Pacific region is expected to grow at the highest CAGR of 19.8% through 2034. This suggests that while North America dominates today, the center of gravity may shift eastward in coming years.\n\nIndustry breakdowns show where AI creates the most value. The software segment dominates with 51.40% of the market share, followed by operations at 21.80%. Among sectors, the BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) segment leads adoption with 19.60% market share, though healthcare is projected to grow at a significant CAGR of 19.10% in coming years.\n\nThese investment patterns indicate that AI has moved decisively beyond experimental phases into core business infrastructure. Organizations across all metrics—implementation, user base, and market value—continue accelerating their AI adoption, positioning artificial intelligence as one of the most significant technological shifts of our time.\n\nAI Adoption by Industry\n-----------------------\n\nAI implementation isn't uniform across sectors. Different industries face unique challenges and opportunities that shape their adoption strategies. Some sectors have surged ahead due to compelling [AI use cases](https://www.netguru.com/blog/ai-failure-examples-how-to-build-an-ai-agent) and clear ROI, while others are still finding their footing.\n\nHere are the five industries setting the pace for AI adoption in 2025.\n\n### Healthcare\n\nHealthcare stands out with an impressive [36.8% compound annual growth rate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2025/06/03/mind-blowing-ai-statistics-everyone-must-know-about-now-in-2025/) in AI adoption. The sector's rapid expansion centers on breakthrough applications in diagnostics, patient management, and clinical documentation. Hospitals and healthcare facilities have dramatically increased their AI investments, focusing on systems that reduce wait times and improve patient outcomes.\n\nClinical documentation has emerged as a particularly valuable application. AI-powered chatbots now handle initial patient inquiries in 42% of major healthcare networks, freeing up staff for more complex care tasks. The technology's ability to analyze complex medical data has transformed everything from drug discovery to personalized treatment plans, creating measurable improvements in patient care quality.\n\n### Manufacturing\n\nManufacturing has embraced AI at a remarkable speed, with 77% of manufacturers now utilizing AI solutions compared to 70% in 2024, a 7% year-over-year increase. [Predictive maintenance](https://www.netguru.com/blog/ai-in-manufacturing) stands out as the primary driver, allowing manufacturers to anticipate equipment failures before they occur.\n\nThe results speak for themselves: companies report an average 23% reduction in downtime from AI-powered process automation and quality control systems. Supply chain optimization ranks equally high among manufacturing priorities, with AI algorithms predicting disruptions and suggesting alternative sourcing strategies in real-time.\n\n### IT & Telecom\n\nIT and telecommunications companies have reached a 38% AI adoption rate as of 2025. This sector projects to add a staggering $4.7 trillion in gross value through AI implementations by 2035. Network optimization represents the most widespread application, with AI systems automatically adjusting resources based on usage patterns.\n\nIndustry-wide alliances like the AI-RAN Alliance have accelerated adoption, focusing specifically on the fusion of AI and cellular technology. Customer experience applications rank second in implementation, with virtual assistants handling approximately 65% of initial customer inquiries across major telecom providers.\n\n### Retail\n\nRetail businesses have dramatically increased their AI investments, now allocating 20% of technology budgets to AI solutions—up from 15% in 2024. This shift reflects growing confidence in AI's ability to drive sales and enhance customer experiences.\n\nThe impact shows up in sales data: retailers that deployed AI-driven chatbots during the 2024 Black Friday sales reported a 15% increase in conversion rates. Behind-the-scenes applications like inventory management and demand forecasting continue delivering significant operational benefits, with AI-powered inventory systems reducing overstocking by an average of 18% across early adopters.\n\n### Finance\n\nFinancial services, including banking, insurance, and investment firms, are investing heavily in AI technologies, with global annual spending exceeding $20 billion in 2025. [Fraud detection](https://www.netguru.com/blog/risk-reducing-ai-use-cases-financial-institutions) remains the primary use case, with AI systems processing millions of transactions per second to identify suspicious patterns.\n\nInvestment firms have been particularly aggressive adopters, with 68% of hedge funds now employing AI for market analysis and trading strategies. Customer-facing applications like robo-advisors have grown in sophistication, now managing over $1.2 trillion in assets globally.\n\nThese five industries represent the vanguard of AI implementation, but the technology's influence continues spreading across all sectors. As AI tools become more accessible and demonstrate clearer ROI, even traditionally cautious industries are accelerating their adoption plans for 2026 and beyond.\n\nHow Organizations Are Scaling AI?\n---------------------------------\n\nAdoption alone doesn't guarantee success. The real challenge lies in scaling AI effectively across the organization, moving beyond isolated experiments to enterprise-wide implementation. Companies that succeed follow structured approaches to maximize impact and ensure sustainable growth.\n\n### Dedicated AI teams and transformation offices\n\nOrganizations scaling AI successfully recognize that technology represents only a fraction of the transformation effort. Forward-thinking companies now follow what BCG calls the \"10–20–70 rule,\" allocating 10% of efforts to algorithms, 20% to technology and data, and a substantial 70% to people and processes. This approach acknowledges a fundamental truth: technology alone cannot drive meaningful change.\n\nThree primary organizational models have emerged for AI governance. The AI Center of Excellence (CoE) model employs a centralized team under a Head of AI who develops and executes company-wide AI strategy. The [Embedded AI](https://www.netguru.com/blog/ai-interface-future) approach distributes capabilities directly into business units for nimble problem-solving. The AI Governance Board model establishes a cross-functional leadership team to guide strategy and control budgets.\n\nCompanies like Eaton have created \"AI factories\" tied to specific business areas, with teams consisting of AI leads, product owners, ML engineers, data engineers, and cloud specialists working alongside domain experts. Research shows that successful organizations increasingly appoint dedicated executives—such as Vice Presidents of AI and Innovation—to lead these transformation efforts.\n\n### Embedding AI into workflows and interfaces\n\nAdding AI tools to existing systems rarely delivers the promised value. True impact comes from seamlessly integrating AI into existing workflows and interfaces. This approach, sometimes called \"embedded AI,\" minimizes disruption while enhancing capabilities. Rather than forcing users to learn entirely new systems, AI gets incorporated directly into familiar tools and processes.\n\nOrganizations following this strategy report significantly higher adoption rates as AI meets users \"where they already are\". [Microsoft has integrated Copilot directly into Microsoft 365](https://www.netguru.com/blog/how-to-use-microsoft-copilot) applications, enabling AI assistance within everyday work tools. This integration method reduces friction and promotes higher adoption across teams.\n\nA critical factor for successful workflow integration involves connecting AI to multiple data sources through APIs and modern data architectures. Companies are developing data fabric models that provide built-in data quality and governance capabilities, allowing data scientists to access information regardless of where it resides.\n\n### Tracking KPIs and ROI from AI solutions\n\nMeasuring AI impact remains challenging yet essential for continued investment. Currently, only about half of AI projects make it from pilot to production, often because organizations struggle to demonstrate tangible business value.\n\nLeading companies address this challenge by defining clear key performance indicators (KPIs) at the outset. These metrics fall into several categories—model quality measures like accuracy and coherence; system metrics including uptime and latency; operational metrics tied to business processes; and business value metrics translating to financial impact.\n\nThe measurement paradox is striking: nearly three-quarters of organizations reported their most advanced AI initiatives met or exceeded ROI expectations in 2024, yet roughly 97% of enterprises still struggled to demonstrate business value from early generative AI efforts. This disconnect highlights the importance of rigorous measurement frameworks.\n\nSuccessful organizations employ various tracking methods, including dashboards for real-time monitoring, regular reports for assessing business impact over time, and periodic audits to ensure AI systems remain accurate and relevant. Connecting these metrics directly to business outcomes helps leaders justify continued investment in AI technologies.\n\n### Internal communication to build AI momentum\n\nStrategic internal communication plays a crucial role in AI adoption and scaling. Boston Consulting Group found that successful AI transformations allocate 70% of their efforts to upskilling people, updating processes, and evolving culture. Without effective communication, even the most sophisticated AI implementations risk failure.\n\nMicrosoft's internal experience demonstrates this principle in practice. Their HR department led a three-step AI transformation process, prioritizing human needs and organizational alignment. Through training sessions and knowledge sharing forums, they helped employees overcome anxiety about AI's impact on their jobs.\n\nThe company established regular \"First Fridays\" learning sessions where product and communications leaders share AI usage insights. They developed prompt libraries to help employees use AI tools effectively in communications. These initiatives create a feedback loop of learning and adjustment with humans at the center.\n\nScaling AI requires more than technology investment—it demands creating a culture of transparency and curiosity where employees feel empowered rather than threatened by AI. Organizations that balance technical implementation with effective communication strategies achieve the most sustainable, enterprise-wide AI adoption.\n\nWorkforce Impact and Reskilling Trends\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe human side of AI adoption tells a complex story. While organizations rush to implement AI solutions, the impact on jobs and workforce composition creates both genuine challenges and significant opportunities. Companies are learning that successful AI adoption isn't just about technology—it's about helping people adapt to new ways of working.\n\n### AI-related hirings\n\nThe demand for AI expertise continues to climb across industries. [Data scientist roles](https://www.netguru.com/glossary/data-science) are projected to grow by an impressive 34% from 2024 to 2034, with approximately 23,400 openings annually. AI/Machine Learning Engineer positions have increased by 143.2% year-over-year, outpacing nearly all other technical roles.\n\nWhat's particularly interesting is how new positions are emerging beyond traditional technical domains. Roles like Prompt Engineer (+135.8%), AI Content Creator (+134.5%), and AI Compliance Officer rank among the fastest-growing jobs in 2025. This trend shows how AI adoption creates specialized positions focused on getting business value while managing risks.\n\nThe compensation reflects this high demand. Data scientists earn a [median salary of $112,590](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/data-scientists.htm) while AI engineers can command up to $171,715 annually. These numbers make the career path attractive for many professionals considering a transition.\n\n### Reskilling initiatives across departments\n\nHere's where things get challenging. Approximately 23% of all jobs are expected to change within the next five years, with 44% of workers' core skills being disrupted. Organizations are responding by prioritizing skill development—nearly half of CEOs now cite employee talent initiatives as their biggest productivity driver, even above AI implementation itself.\n\nThe gap between intention and execution remains significant. Almost two-thirds of employees report their company's learning and development programs don't adequately support their success in this new environment. Forward-thinking organizations are addressing this through AI-powered training programs and \"AI champions\" who drive adoption within departments.\n\n### Time saved by AI redirected to new tasks\n\nAI tools now save workers an average of 52-60 minutes daily across industries. How people use this reclaimed time varies considerably:\n\n*   28% use it for more creative work.\n*   26% spend it on strategic thinking.\n*   27% report achieving better work-life balance.\n\nA pivotal question emerges about who \"owns\" this saved time. Nearly half of employees (46%) believe the time they save using AI belongs to them rather than their company. Most (77%) would still use at least half of their reclaimed time on work-related activities. This dynamic will likely shape future workplace policies and expectations.\n\n### Headcount changes vary by industry\n\nDespite widespread concerns about job displacement, AI adoption is having a more nuanced impact on employment levels. AI is expected to increase unemployment by only half a percentage point during the transition period. Approximately 6-7% of US workforce positions could be displaced by widespread AI adoption, but this effect appears to be temporary.\n\n[AI investment](https://www.netguru.com/blog/future-of-ai) actually correlates with increased overall employment, though workforce composition shifts toward more educated and technically skilled workers. A one-standard-deviation increase in firm-level AI investment corresponds with a 3.7% increase in college-educated workers and decreases in both middle management (-0.8%) and senior management (-0.7%) positions.\n\nThis evolution highlights the critical importance of reskilling programs that help workers adapt to changing technical demands while preserving organizational knowledge. Companies that get this balance right will have a significant advantage in attracting and retaining talent.\n\nManaging AI Risks and Governance\n--------------------------------\n\nOrganizations racing to deploy AI face a sobering reality: the technology that promises to drive growth also introduces new categories of risk. Companies have discovered that [robust governance frameworks](https://www.netguru.com/blog/build-ai-risk-management-systems) aren't optional extras—they're fundamental requirements for responsible AI deployment and long-term success.\n\n### Three critical risks demand immediate attention\n\nAI systems create challenges that traditional technologies simply don't present. Inaccuracy tops the list of concerns, as AI models can produce hallucinations and misleading outputs that damage business credibility. What makes this particularly troubling is how confident these systems can sound while being completely wrong.\n\nIntellectual property infringement has emerged as the second major challenge, with training data often containing copyrighted materials without proper authorization. Legal teams are scrambling to understand liability exposure as courts begin ruling on AI-related IP cases.\n\nCybersecurity represents the third critical risk area. Generative AI tools have become prime targets for adversarial attacks and data theft. The numbers tell the story: nearly three-quarters (73%) of organizations plan to increase their cybersecurity investments because of generative AI programs. Yet only 24% of current generative AI projects are adequately secured, creating a dangerous vulnerability gap.\n\n### Boards step up to AI oversight\n\nThe days of treating AI as purely a technical concern are over. Boards now recognize AI governance as a critical responsibility requiring direct oversight. 80% of organizations have established dedicated risk functions specifically for AI, reflecting how seriously leadership takes these challenges.\n\nAccording to PwC, effective board oversight means ensuring AI strategy aligns with business objectives while balancing innovation with responsible implementation. This isn't about slowing down AI adoption—it's about making sure it happens safely.\n\nCEOs and senior leadership are setting the tone for ethical AI use through focused planning and disciplined execution. This includes investing in employee training, developing internal policies, and creating open communication channels. The stakes are clear: [96% of leaders acknowledge](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-risk-management) that adopting generative AI makes security breaches more likely.\n\n### Finding the right governance structure\n\nOrganizations have experimented with various governance approaches, each offering different trade-offs. Centralized models ensure consistent standards and compliance but can hamper innovation. Decentralized approaches give business units flexibility but risk inconsistent implementation.\n\nThe sweet spot seems to be hybrid \"Center of Excellence\" structures that combine centralized expertise with distributed application. These frameworks establish clear accountability while allowing for business-specific customization. Successful organizations implement centralized monitoring and auditing to track performance across all AI applications.\n\n### Quality control becomes non-negotiable\n\nAI outputs often require verification, making quality control essential rather than optional. Human review remains the most effective method, with editors examining content for factual accuracy, tone consistency, and relevance. Organizations also implement plagiarism detection tools to verify originality and prevent intellectual property issues.\n\nCross-referencing data from multiple credible sources has become standard practice for ensuring AI-generated information reliability. The vast majority of companies now employ both human reviews and standalone testing tools to address generative AI's [quality control](https://www.netguru.com/blog/software-quality) challenges.\n\nThe message is clear: organizations that treat AI risk management as an afterthought do so at their own peril. Those that build governance into their AI strategy from the beginning position themselves for sustainable success.\n\nFuture Market Projections and Emerging Trends\n---------------------------------------------\n\nWhat comes next for artificial intelligence? Current adoption rates tell only part of the story. The AI landscape shows signs of explosive growth that could reshape entire economies in the coming years.\n\n### Market value could reach $1.81 trillion by 2030\n\nThe AI market's trajectory suggests we're still in the early stages of a much larger transformation. From a valuation of $279.22 billion in 2024, analysts project the market will reach $1.81 trillion by 2030, expanding at a compound annual growth rate of 35.9%. Some projections push even higher, suggesting the market could soar to $4.8 trillion by 2033.\n\nThis growth rate outpaces both the cloud computing boom of the 2010s and the mobile app economy surge. The scale of this expansion indicates AI will become as fundamental to business operations as the internet itself.\n\n### AI agents represent the next frontier\n\nTraditional AI responds to prompts and questions. Agentic AI systems that understand complex goals and take autonomous actions represent a fundamental shift toward truly independent AI agents. The market for AI agents is expected to grow to $52.6 billion by 2030, with a remarkable 45% CAGR.\n\nOrganizations are taking notice. Over 50% now identify agentic AI as a priority development area. The impact could be substantial: by 2028, approximately 15% of work decisions will likely be made autonomously by agentic AI, compared to 0% in 2024.\n\n### Wearable AI market reaches new heights\n\nThe wearable AI sector has emerged as a standout segment, jumping from $41.13 billion in 2024 to between $53.14 and $71.8 billion in 2025. Projections show continued acceleration, with the market expanding to $138.5-$161.71 billion by 2029 at CAGR estimates ranging from 17.2% to 32.1%.\n\nAdvances in flexible display technologies, sensor miniaturization, and AI-powered health monitoring capabilities are driving this growth. These developments suggest AI will soon become as personal and ubiquitous as smartphones are today.\n\n### Government investments signal strategic importance\n\nGovernments worldwide recognize AI as a strategic priority worth substantial investment. The US federal government's AI spending reached $3.3 billion in 2022—2.5 times the 2017 figure. Japan allocated approximately $740 million for AI computing, while India committed $1.25 billion to its IndiaAI Mission. South Korea plans to invest $6.94 billion by 2027.\n\nThese investments reflect a broader understanding that AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Countries are positioning themselves for what many consider the next great economic transformation—one that will determine competitive advantages for decades to come.\n\nThe Path Forward\n----------------\n\nThe story these numbers tell is clear: artificial intelligence has crossed the threshold from experimental technology to a business essential. Organizations that once approached AI cautiously are now embedding it across multiple functions, driven by compelling returns on investment and competitive necessity.\n\nWhat makes this shift particularly remarkable is its breadth. We're witnessing adoption across healthcare diagnostics, manufacturing, predictive maintenance, retail inventory systems, and financial fraud detection simultaneously. The 78% adoption rate reflects not just widespread acceptance, but strategic integration across core business operations.\n\nThe most successful organizations share common approaches. They build dedicated teams, embed AI into existing workflows rather than creating separate systems, and invest heavily in employee communication and training. These companies understand that technology alone doesn't drive success—people and processes determine whether AI initiatives thrive or stagnate.\n\nYet challenges remain significant. Risk management has emerged as a critical discipline, with boards and senior executives taking direct oversight of AI governance. The gap between pilot projects and production deployment continues to challenge many organizations, highlighting the importance of clear measurement frameworks and quality control processes.\n\nThe workforce implications deserve particular attention. While AI saves workers nearly an hour daily on average, the bigger story lies in how this time gets redirected toward higher-value activities. Organizations investing in comprehensive reskilling programs position themselves to benefit from this productivity dividend while supporting employee adaptation.\n\nMarket projections suggest we're still in the early stages of this transformation. The potential growth to $1.81 trillion by 2030, combined with emerging capabilities like agentic AI systems, indicates that current adoption rates may accelerate further. Government investments worldwide signal recognition that AI competitiveness will determine economic advantages in the coming decade.\n\nFor business leaders, the question has shifted from whether to adopt AI to how quickly and effectively they can scale it. Companies establishing robust governance frameworks while fostering cultures of AI literacy will likely capture the greatest advantages as this technology continues reshaping business operations across every sector.\n\n[AI & Data Science](https://www.netguru.com/blog/topic/ai-data-science)\n\n![Image 10: Photo of Kacper

Since then, we have conducted our survey—[the Real-Time Population Survey](https://sites.google.com/view/covid-rps)—on a quarterly basis. In this blog post, we share an update on the state of generative AI adoption by U.S. workers and look for evidence of this technology’s impact in the broader economy.\n\nTo make our findings accessible, we are also releasing a [public tracker](http://genaiadoptiontracker.com/) with adoption rates across different settings (overall, work, nonwork) as well as some breakdowns by industry and occupation. The tracker also includes data on time savings by industry and occupation, which will be updated on a quarterly basis.\n\nGenerative AI Adoption Continues to Climb\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe first figure plots overall adoption rates, both for work and for nonwork, from August 2024 to August 2025. Our survey found that in August 2024, 44.6% of adults ages 18 to 64 used generative AI overall.While conducting our August 2025 survey, we tested our sequencing of questions related to generative AI awareness and use. As a result, we found that the initial results underestimated usage. In response, we applied a reweighting adjustment to our 2024 surveys and February and May 2025 surveys. (See Appendix A.2.1 in our [updated working paper](https://fedinprint.org/item/fedlwp/98805/102025) for details.) Our initial result for generative AI usage was 39.4% in August 2024; by revising the sequencing, our updated result for August 2024 is 44.6%. In the last 12 months, adoption of this new technology increased by 10 percentage points to 54.6%.\n\n**Generative AI Adoption: Overall, Work, and Nonwork**\n\n![Image 15: A line chart shows steady increase in generative AI adoption for 12 months ended August 2025. The rate for overall, nonwork and work rose from 45%, 36% and 33%, respectively, in August 2024, to 55%, 49% and 37% in August 2025.

August 2025 is roughly three years after the release of ChatGPT, the first mass-market generative AI product. The current generative AI adoption rate of 54.6% exceeds the 19.7% adoption rate of the personal computer (PC) in 1984, three years after the first mass-market computer (the IBM PC in 1981), and the internet’s 30.1% adoption rate in 1998, three years after the internet was opened to commercial traffic.Internet adoption between 1997 and 1998 grew by 8.6 percentage points. Between 1984 and 1989, the next period the data on PC usage by U.S. households are available, adoption grew, on average, by 1.2 percentage points per year.\n\nThe first figure also breaks down overall adoption by work versus nonwork uses. In the last 12 months, work adoption increased from 33.3% to 37.4%. Nonwork adoption increased even more rapidly, from 36.0% to 48.7%. Along both dimensions, three years after the introduction of the first mass-market product, generative AI adoption is higher than the adoption of PCs, which was 25.1% for work and 5.5% for nonwork.\n\nBeyond the Adoption Rate: Intensity of Use at Work\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n Beyond measuring how many workers use generative AI, our survey also allows us to measure how much time workers spend using this technology for their jobs. We can only do this in more detail starting in November 2024. For the entire U.S. workforce ages 18 to 64, the share of work hours spent using generative AI increased from 4.1% in November 2024 to 5.7% in August 2025. \nIs There Evidence that Generative AI Is Impacting Productivity?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA pressing question is whether generative AI is already affecting aggregate economic data. One margin along which generative AI might impact the economy is by increasing labor productivity; for example, by allowing workers to get more done in less time.\n\nOur survey asks generative AI users how many additional hours they would need to work to get the same amount done if they had not had access to generative AI. We pooled the data from our February, May and August 2025 surveys, and then calculated the aggregate time savings. Factoring in all workers, including nonusers, workers report generative AI time savings equivalent to 1.6% of all work hours.\n\nWhen we feed these estimates into a standard aggregate production model, this suggests that generative AI may have increased labor productivity by up to 1.3% since the introduction of ChatGPT. This is consistent with recent estimates of aggregate labor productivity in the U.S. nonfarm business sector. For example, productivity increased at an average rate of 1.43% per year from 2015-2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. By contrast, from the fourth quarter of 2022 through the second quarter of 2025, aggregate labor productivity increased by 2.16% on an annualized basis. Relative to its prepandemic trend, this corresponds to excess cumulative productivity growth of 1.89 percentage points since ChatGPT was publicly released.Specifically, we first regress logarithmic labor productivity between 2015 and 2019 on a time trend, predicted labor productivity (in levels) for the postpandemic period, and then subtracted the growth rate of these predicted values from the actual growth rate.\n\nThese estimates require several important caveats. On the one hand, increased productivity by workers in some tasks will not increase measured productivity by as much if workers apply their saved time to less-productive activities, such as lower-value tasks, or on job leisure (e.g., doing personal online shopping while at work). On the other hand, our estimates will not capture firm-side adjustments to capital or work reorganizations, which, if they occurred, could lead to additional productivity gains.\n\nEarly Evidence from Industry-Level Data\n---------------------------------------\n\nAn additional test for potential productivity gains from AI is to ask whether industries which adopt AI at higher rates also experienced more rapid productivity growth.\n\nTo account for differences in preexisting trends, we subtracted a prepandemic trend from each industry’s productivity growth. We then correlated this detrended productivity growth with industry-level time savings—the main input in our productivity calculations.In our productivity calculation, we weight time savings by wages but refrain from doing this in the second figure for simplicity. We exclude two sectors from our analysis: agriculture, because the corresponding BLS employment numbers are not available, and mining, because of the strong impact of large swings in commodity prices. The correlation is 0.32, indicating that high-adoption industries tended to have growth faster than their prepandemic trend.\n\n**Labor Productivity Growth and Industry-Level Usage of Generative AI**\n\n![Image 16: A scatter plot shows the relationship between an industry’s detrended labor productivity growth and the time savings generated by generative AI (measured as a percentage of work hours in a previous week). Further description in surrounding text.](https://www.stlouisfed.org/-/media/project/frbstl/stlouisfed/blog/2025/ote/nov/blogimage_genai_productivityupdate_fig2_111325.png?sc_lang=en&hash=7F656FBDEF41F329B1A0F5035246C67A)\nSOURCES: Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Real-Time Population Survey and authors’ calculations.\n\nNOTE: The dashed red line is a regression line and the slope coefficient is 2.7; the correlation between both variables is 0.32.\n\nAs shown by the dashed red line in the second figure, on average, industries with 1 percentage point higher time savings experienced 2.7 percentage points higher productivity growth relative to their prepandemic trend. We stress that this correlation cannot be interpreted as causal, and that labor productivity is determined by many factors. However, the current results are suggestive that generative AI may already be noticeably affecting industry-level productivity.For another analysis using our original 2024 data, see Oksana Leukhina and Mickenzie Bass’ 2025 _On the Economy_ blog post, “[Industry-Level Growth, AI Use and the U.S. Postpandemic Recovery](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2025/may/industry-level-growth-ai-use-us-postpandemic-recovery).”\n\nLooking Ahead\n-------------\n\nOur findings help shed light on a rapidly evolving technology. Generative AI use has grown substantially over the past year, both for work and nonwork. Reported time savings at work by users suggest that generative AI may have already meaningfully increased aggregate labor productivity. Consistent with this, industries with higher reported time savings also tended to experience faster measured productivity growth since the release of ChatGPT than prepandemic trends would suggest. However, we caution that this relationship could be due to confounding factors.\n\nAs we continue to track generative AI adoption in future surveys, we will gain a clearer picture of how this general-purpose technology is reshaping work, productivity and the broader economy.\n\n**Notes**\n\n1.

Most modern automation tools, like LeadSquared, offer drag-and-drop interfaces—making it possible for users with little technical background to set up and manage automations with ease. Access to pre-built templates further lowers the learning curve, letting you get started quickly with common processes such as onboarding, approvals, or lead routing.\n\n**Mobile-friendliness** is another aspect of usability. Platforms that support access and approvals on-the-go, either through dedicated apps or responsive web interfaces, enable busy teams to stay on track regardless of location. Clean navigation, clear setup steps, and helpful tooltips all contribute to keeping workload automation approachable for everyone in your organization.\n\n### **Customization: Adapting to any workflow**\n\nCustomization is where these platforms really differentiate themselves. Some tools let you go beyond simple triggers and actions, supporting multi-branch workflows that handle a variety of conditions and exceptions.**For instance**, platforms like LeadSquared, Monday.com and Kissflow provide **robust options for branching, complex approvals, and even conditional logic**—ideal for organizations with intricate processes.\n\nPower users may appreciate advanced capabilities such as custom script editors or the ability to weave in API integrations directly. This kind of customization is essential when you need to automate industry-specific processes or connect with legacy systems. On the other hand, no-code options abound for teams wanting to create automations without involving IT, keeping workflows agile and scalable.\n\n### **Striking a balance**\n\nOf course, there’s no perfect tool—platforms that score high on customization may require more governance to ensure your automations remain organized and manageable, while the most user-friendly platforms might offer fewer options for building sophisticated, multi-stage workflows.\n\nUltimately, the [**best workflow automation software**](https://www.leadsquared.com/) is one that matches your team’s technical comfort level and specific business needs. Whether you prioritize an effortless setup, deep customization, or a bit of both, a thorough assessment of these qualities will help ensure the chosen platform can scale alongside your organization’s ambitions.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe top workflow automation software platforms listed in this blog offer a wide range of features and capabilities to meet the needs of businesses of all sizes and industries.\n\nWhile all the tools listed are great options, [LeadSquared’s workflow automation platform](https://www.leadsquared.com/customer-journey-builder/) stands out with its powerful [marketing automation](https://www.leadsquared.com/marketing-automation/) capabilities and focus on lead generation and management.

management\n\nLearn how to create effective Agile project management workflows. Explore workflow types, key components, and best practices to boost team efficiency.\n\nBy Atlassian\n\nCreate clear and achievable project objectives with the free workflow template\n\nDefine steps, assign tasks, and track progress to keep your projects on the right path with a structured workflow.\n\n[Use template](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/templates/workflow)\n\nEvery software team has a process for completing work. Establishing that process as a workflow makes it structured, repeatable, and scalable.\n\nUnderstanding why workflows are essential helps teams manage tasks that follow a specific sequence, ensuring project goals are met efficiently. When combined with a well-defined project scope, workflows help improve project planning and other [project management phases](/work-management/project-management/phases).\n\nWorkflows support your decision-making process, help you achieve objectives more efficiently, and deliver outcomes closely aligned with business needs and goals.\n\nHere we’ll define workflows and their different types, outline the key phases of effective project management workflows within [agile](/agile), and offer specific steps to help you and your teams create the most efficient project workflows.\n\n## What is a workflow?\n\nA workflow defines a sequence of workflow steps that guide a project from start to finish. Workflows typically involve multiple steps that must be completed in a specific order.\n\nEach workflow details the roles, processes, and tasks required to achieve project objectives and ensure completion.\n\n## The different types of workflows\n\nSeveral popular [project management methodologies](/blog/project-management/project-management-methodologies) are used in software development, including Agile, DevOps, Kanban, Lean, the [Waterfall methodology](/agile/project-management/waterfall-methodology), and hybrid.\n\nEach methodology has its own features and workflows that make it well-suited to particular types of projects and business needs. Organizations rely on different workflows to address specific business requirements:\n\n* **Sequential workflows** follow a strict, ordered sequence of tasks for consistency, while parallel workflows offer efficiency, so multiple tasks or departments can operate simultaneously. State machine workflows are flexible to pivot between states based on conditions or feedback.\n* **System-centric workflows** are automated and managed by machines, while human-centric workflows depend on people for approvals or verifications. Custom workflows are tailored to meet unique organizational needs, manual workflow requires human intervention, and digital workflows are managed through software.\n* **Multiple workflows** can be integrated to handle complex business processes involving various tasks and stakeholders. A workflow tool is software designed to help create, execute, and manage these workflows efficiently.\n* **Kanban, Lean, Waterfall, and hybrid workflows** are particularly popular with manufacturing and service companies. Software developers also use them, but software development uses Agile more than any other methodology, which will be the focus of this article.\n\n## Workflow components\n\nEvery effective workflow process is built from core components. This guides work from initiation to completion.\n\nThese components include clearly defined tasks or activities, the specific sequence in which these tasks are performed, and the resources or inputs required at each step. Organizations create efficient workflows that minimize manual effort and streamline processes by mapping out these elements.\n\n## The importance of Agile project management workflows\n\nAgile workflows provide a structured path for project execution. This helps development teams achieve and ensure clarity, efficiency, and coordination throughout the [project life cycle](/work-management/project-management/project-life-cycle).\n\nLike process workflows, they offer a structured path, providing clarity and predictability for project tasks and milestones. They help manage the project delivery process by coordinating all activities from initiation to completion.\n\nAgile workflows streamline tasks and reduce bottlenecks. You can quickly enhance productivity by allowing teams to focus on high-value tasks.\n\nImplementing effective Agile workflows delivers significant business impact by ensuring that critical projects align with organizational goals and resources are allocated to maximize value.\n\n## Phases of an effective project management workflow\n\nA [project management workflow](/agile/project-management/workflow) ensures consistency and reliability in project execution by providing a structured approach to managing tasks and processes. It typically progresses through the following four phases:\n\n* **Initiation**: Defines [project goals](/work-management/project-management/project-objectives), scope, and initial resources.\n* **Planning**: Where teams break down tasks, create schedules, and allocate resources.\n* **Execution**: Implements tasks according to the plan and manages team performance.\n* **Monitoring and control**: Tracks progress and adjusts to ensure project success and continuous improvement.\n\nWorkflow automation can streamline these phases by reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency. A workflow management system and various workflow systems help manage, monitor, and optimize each phase for better organizational performance.\n\nIdentifying and managing workflow steps within each phase is crucial for improving efficiency. A workflow's basic components include inputs, tasks, and outputs, forming the foundation for effective workflow management.\n\n## How to create an Agile workflow to guarantee project success\n\n### 1. **Define essential project goals**\n\nOutline project objectives, deliverables, and constraints. Collaborate with team members, stakeholders, and business leaders to understand their expectations and optimize by aligning your project goals with business needs and goals.\n\n### **2. Break down tasks and milestones for faster adjustments**\n\nDivide the project into manageable tasks and set assertive but achievable milestones for them. Carefully balance the desire to deliver outcomes quickly with available resources. Consider delivering outcomes conforming to anticipated goals and objectives with minimal errors or rework.\n\n### **3. Assign tasks and responsibilities to hold stakeholders accountable**\n\nAllocate tasks and assign responsibilities to team members based on skills and availability. Utilize [resource management tools](/software/jira/features/resource-management-tools) to secure accurate and complete information about team member availability.\n\nThis helps avoid conflicting or overlapping assignments of critical people. Assigning clear ownership and responsibilities also helps ensure accountability within the team.\n\n### **4. Create a timeline and schedule to align on expectations**\n\nBuild a detailed timeline with clear deadlines and dependencies. Highlight all known and anticipated potential conflicts or delays.\n\nBreaking down tasks and milestones in project timelines provides structure and facilitates tracking progress by identifying dependencies and potential bottlenecks.\n\n### 5. **Monitor progress and adjust on the fly**\n\nEnsure you have effective workflows and processes to monitor progress, identify issues, and make necessary adjustments to keep your project on track. Where possible and appropriate, include steps that support efforts.\n\n## Workflow management and automation\n\nWorkflow management and automation are key drivers of efficiency and productivity in modern organizations. It involves defining, analyzing, and optimizing the flow of information and tasks within business processes.\n\nBusinesses gain greater control over their workflows by implementing workflow management systems. This instills confidence at each step of the project to better execute according to established business rules.\n\nAutomation takes workflow management to the next level by using technology to handle repetitive tasks and routine processes. Robotic process automation (RPA) is a powerful tool for automating data entry, document processing, and other manual activities.\n\nWith features like drag-and-drop capabilities, predictive analytics, and rules-driven workflows, organizations easily design and automate complex workflows.  This reduces manual effort and human error, accelerates processing time, and enhances workflow efficiency.\n\n## Common challenges to workflow management and helpful solutions\n\nDespite the transformative power of workflow management, organizations often encounter common workflow challenges. These issues include unclear processes, inefficient workflows, and a lack of proper workflow management tools.\n\nEach can result in delays, increased manual effort, and higher operational costs. So, to address these challenges, businesses can implement workflow management systems and tools that provide visibility and control over every aspect of their workflows.\n\nAutomating repetitive tasks with robotic process automation (RPA) reduces manual effort and streamlines operations.\n\nBy regularly analyzing workflows and leveraging workflow management software, organizations can identify inefficiencies, optimize processes, and achieve significant cost savings.\n\nThese improvements lead to enhanced productivity, better decision-making, and more efficient business processes, helping organizations reach their goals and maintain a competitive edge.\n\n## Workflow automation best practices\n\nEffective workflows enable you to automate and standardize multiple project management tasks and processes. [Jira’s automation](/software/jira/features/automation) capabilities streamline workflows and supercharge processes by removing bottlenecks and scaling project operations.\n\nYou can further enhance the value of your workflows with these best practices:\n\n* **Communicate clearly**. Establish frequent, regular communication with your teams. Encourage them to share any information that could affect their ability to keep their effort on track.\n* **Engage stakeholders**. Stakeholders affected by your projects can also affect those efforts. Keep them engaged throughout each project journey, encourage their support, and address their concerns quickly and credibly.\n* **Improve continuously**. Gather feedback from developers and stakeholders. Take careful note of what went well and anything that did not. Use that information to drive incremental adjustments and improvements to those outcomes, workflows, and processes.\n* **Keep things simple**. Complex processes are difficult to grasp, implement, and adjust. Here are some recommended workflow states:\n\nLeveraging operations research and artificial intelligence can optimize workflows by applying advanced analytical methods and automation to solve complex problems and improve efficiency.\n\n## Optimize project management workflows with Jira\n\nEffective workflows can provide a firm, flexible foundation for consistently successful Agile development projects and progress toward continuous improvement and delivery. Well-crafted processes help you and your teams develop, execute, and manage those workflows.\n\nWith [Jira workflows](/software/jira/features/workflows), facilitate [task tracking](/agile/project-management/task-tracker), team collaboration, issue management, and reporting, while supporting Agile and other project management methodologies.\n\n[Try Jira for

management\n\nLearn how to create effective Agile project management workflows. Explore workflow types, key components, and best practices to boost team efficiency.\n\nBy Atlassian\n\nCreate clear and achievable project objectives with the free workflow template\n\nDefine steps, assign tasks, and track progress to keep your projects on the right path with a structured workflow.\n\n[Use template](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/templates/workflow)\n\nEvery software team has a process for completing work. Establishing that process as a workflow makes it structured, repeatable, and scalable.\n\nUnderstanding why workflows are essential helps teams manage tasks that follow a specific sequence, ensuring project goals are met efficiently. When combined with a well-defined project scope, workflows help improve project planning and other [project management phases](/work-management/project-management/phases).\n\nWorkflows support your decision-making process, help you achieve objectives more efficiently, and deliver outcomes closely aligned with business needs and goals.\n\nHere we’ll define workflows and their different types, outline the key phases of effective project management workflows within [agile](/agile), and offer specific steps to help you and your teams create the most efficient project workflows.\n\n## What is a workflow?\n\nA workflow defines a sequence of workflow steps that guide a project from start to finish. Workflows typically involve multiple steps that must be completed in a specific order.\n\nEach workflow details the roles, processes, and tasks required to achieve project objectives and ensure completion.\n\n## The different types of workflows\n\nSeveral popular [project management methodologies](/blog/project-management/project-management-methodologies) are used in software development, including Agile, DevOps, Kanban, Lean, the [Waterfall methodology](/agile/project-management/waterfall-methodology), and hybrid.\n\nEach methodology has its own features and workflows that make it well-suited to particular types of projects and business needs. Organizations rely on different workflows to address specific business requirements:\n\n* **Sequential workflows** follow a strict, ordered sequence of tasks for consistency, while parallel workflows offer efficiency, so multiple tasks or departments can operate simultaneously. State machine workflows are flexible to pivot between states based on conditions or feedback.\n* **System-centric workflows** are automated and managed by machines, while human-centric workflows depend on people for approvals or verifications. Custom workflows are tailored to meet unique organizational needs, manual workflow requires human intervention, and digital workflows are managed through software.\n* **Multiple workflows** can be integrated to handle complex business processes involving various tasks and stakeholders. A workflow tool is software designed to help create, execute, and manage these workflows efficiently.\n* **Kanban, Lean, Waterfall, and hybrid workflows** are particularly popular with manufacturing and service companies. Software developers also use them, but software development uses Agile more than any other methodology, which will be the focus of this article.\n\n## Workflow components\n\nEvery effective workflow process is built from core components. This guides work from initiation to completion.\n\nThese components include clearly defined tasks or activities, the specific sequence in which these tasks are performed, and the resources or inputs required at each step. Organizations create efficient workflows that minimize manual effort and streamline processes by mapping out these elements.\n\n## The importance of Agile project management workflows\n\nAgile workflows provide a structured path for project execution. This helps development teams achieve and ensure clarity, efficiency, and coordination throughout the [project life cycle](/work-management/project-management/project-life-cycle).\n\nLike process workflows, they offer a structured path, providing clarity and predictability for project tasks and milestones. They help manage the project delivery process by coordinating all activities from initiation to completion.\n\nAgile workflows streamline tasks and reduce bottlenecks. You can quickly enhance productivity by allowing teams to focus on high-value tasks.\n\nImplementing effective Agile workflows delivers significant business impact by ensuring that critical projects align with organizational goals and resources are allocated to maximize value.\n\n## Phases of an effective project management workflow\n\nA [project management workflow](/agile/project-management/workflow) ensures consistency and reliability in project execution by providing a structured approach to managing tasks and processes. It typically progresses through the following four phases:\n\n* **Initiation**: Defines [project goals](/work-management/project-management/project-objectives), scope, and initial resources.\n* **Planning**: Where teams break down tasks, create schedules, and allocate resources.\n* **Execution**: Implements tasks according to the plan and manages team performance.\n* **Monitoring and control**: Tracks progress and adjusts to ensure project success and continuous improvement.\n\nWorkflow automation can streamline these phases by reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency. A workflow management system and various workflow systems help manage, monitor, and optimize each phase for better organizational performance.\n\nIdentifying and managing workflow steps within each phase is crucial for improving efficiency. A workflow's basic components include inputs, tasks, and outputs, forming the foundation for effective workflow management.\n\n## How to create an Agile workflow to guarantee project success\n\n### 1. **Define essential project goals**\n\nOutline project objectives, deliverables, and constraints. Collaborate with team members, stakeholders, and business leaders to understand their expectations and optimize by aligning your project goals with business needs and goals.\n\n### **2. Break down tasks and milestones for faster adjustments**\n\nDivide the project into manageable tasks and set assertive but achievable milestones for them. Carefully balance the desire to deliver outcomes quickly with available resources. Consider delivering outcomes conforming to anticipated goals and objectives with minimal errors or rework.\n\n### **3. Assign tasks and responsibilities to hold stakeholders accountable**\n\nAllocate tasks and assign responsibilities to team members based on skills and availability. Utilize [resource management tools](/software/jira/features/resource-management-tools) to secure accurate and complete information about team member availability.\n\nThis helps avoid conflicting or overlapping assignments of critical people. Assigning clear ownership and responsibilities also helps ensure accountability within the team.\n\n### **4. Create a timeline and schedule to align on expectations**\n\nBuild a detailed timeline with clear deadlines and dependencies. Highlight all known and anticipated potential conflicts or delays.\n\nBreaking down tasks and milestones in project timelines provides structure and facilitates tracking progress by identifying dependencies and potential bottlenecks.\n\n### 5. **Monitor progress and adjust on the fly**\n\nEnsure you have effective workflows and processes to monitor progress, identify issues, and make necessary adjustments to keep your project on track. Where possible and appropriate, include steps that support efforts.\n\n## Workflow management and automation\n\nWorkflow management and automation are key drivers of efficiency and productivity in modern organizations. It involves defining, analyzing, and optimizing the flow of information and tasks within business processes.\n\nBusinesses gain greater control over their workflows by implementing workflow management systems. This instills confidence at each step of the project to better execute according to established business rules.\n\nAutomation takes workflow management to the next level by using technology to handle repetitive tasks and routine processes. Robotic process automation (RPA) is a powerful tool for automating data entry, document processing, and other manual activities.\n\nWith features like drag-and-drop capabilities, predictive analytics, and rules-driven workflows, organizations easily design and automate complex workflows.  This reduces manual effort and human error, accelerates processing time, and enhances workflow efficiency.\n\n## Common challenges to workflow management and helpful solutions\n\nDespite the transformative power of workflow management, organizations often encounter common workflow challenges. These issues include unclear processes, inefficient workflows, and a lack of proper workflow management tools.\n\nEach can result in delays, increased manual effort, and higher operational costs. So, to address these challenges, businesses can implement workflow management systems and tools that provide visibility and control over every aspect of their workflows.\n\nAutomating repetitive tasks with robotic process automation (RPA) reduces manual effort and streamlines operations.\n\nBy regularly analyzing workflows and leveraging workflow management software, organizations can identify inefficiencies, optimize processes, and achieve significant cost savings.\n\nThese improvements lead to enhanced productivity, better decision-making, and more efficient business processes, helping organizations reach their goals and maintain a competitive edge.\n\n## Workflow automation best practices\n\nEffective workflows enable you to automate and standardize multiple project management tasks and processes. [Jira’s automation](/software/jira/features/automation) capabilities streamline workflows and supercharge processes by removing bottlenecks and scaling project operations.\n\nYou can further enhance the value of your workflows with these best practices:\n\n* **Communicate clearly**. Establish frequent, regular communication with your teams. Encourage them to share any information that could affect their ability to keep their effort on track.\n* **Engage stakeholders**. Stakeholders affected by your projects can also affect those efforts. Keep them engaged throughout each project journey, encourage their support, and address their concerns quickly and credibly.\n* **Improve continuously**. Gather feedback from developers and stakeholders. Take careful note of what went well and anything that did not. Use that information to drive incremental adjustments and improvements to those outcomes, workflows, and processes.\n* **Keep things simple**. Complex processes are difficult to grasp, implement, and adjust. Here are some recommended workflow states:\n\nLeveraging operations research and artificial intelligence can optimize workflows by applying advanced analytical methods and automation to solve complex problems and improve efficiency.\n\n## Optimize project management workflows with Jira\n\nEffective workflows can provide a firm, flexible foundation for consistently successful Agile development projects and progress toward continuous improvement and delivery. Well-crafted processes help you and your teams develop, execute, and manage those workflows.\n\nWith [Jira workflows](/software/jira/features/workflows), facilitate [task tracking](/agile/project-management/task-tracker), team collaboration, issue management, and reporting, while supporting Agile and other project management methodologies.\n\n[Try Jira for free](/software/jira)\n\n## Recommended for you\n\nTemplates\n\n### Ready-made Jira templates\n\nBrowse our library of custom Jira templates for various teams, departments, and workflows.\n\n[Go to Jira templates](/software/jira/templates)\n\nProduct guide\n\n### A comprehensive introduction to Jira\n\nUse this step-by-step guide to discover essential features and the best practices to maximize your productivity.\n\n[Go to Jira Product guide](/software/jira/guides/getting-started/introduction#what-is-jira-software)\n\nGit Guide\n\n### Understanding the Basics of Git\n\nFrom beginners to advanced experts, use this guide to Git to learn the basics with helpful tutorials and tips.\n\n[Read More](/git)\n\n## Manage Preferences\n\nWhen you visit any website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.

It was inefficient. And it wasn’t scalable. That all changed when they switched to SweetProcess.\n\nBy organizing their SOPs in one place, automating [process documentation](https://www.sweetprocess.com/process-documentation/), and assigning responsibilities more clearly, they turned onboarding into a smooth, hands-off experience.\n\nThe payoff? Managers saved time, errors dropped, and new hires got up to speed without constant hand-holding.\n\nIf you’ve dealt with jumbled workflows, disorganized knowledge, or the classic “who’s doing what” confusion, congrats—you’re in good company.\n\nHonestly, process improvement isn’t just nice to have. For growing teams, it’s a must. The right tools don’t just make life easier—they keep your operations from falling apart.\n\n*Curious [*how Thimbleberry cleaned up their chaos*](https://www.sweetprocess.com/how-thimbleberry-financial-improved-its-employee-onboarding-with-effective-documentation/)? SweetProcess helped them streamline, scale, and finally get their team aligned without micromanaging.*\n\n[**Try SweetProcess free for 14 days**](https://www.sweetprocess.com/accounts/signup/) (no credit card needed) and see what smoother workflows feel like.\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n[What Are Process Improvement Tools?](#definition)\n\n[9 Best Process Improvement Tools for Better Workflows](#list)\n\n[Why Choose SweetProcess as Your Process Improvement Tool](#sweetprocess)\n\n[Why Use a Process Improvement Tool?](#why-use)\n\n[Best Practices for Implementing Process Improvement Tools](#best-practices)\n\n[Which Process Improvement Tool Is Right for Your Company?](#verdict)\n\n## **What Are Process Improvement Tools?**\n\n[Process improvement](https://www.sweetprocess.com/process-improvement/) is about working smarter, not harder. It’s the practice of identifying what’s inefficient, slow, or inconsistent in the way work gets done and making changes to improve it next time.\n\nThe aim is simple. Reduce waste, minimize errors, and achieve more reliable results.\n\nThis idea has been around for a long time.\n\n[Inventors and innovators have been refining processes for over a hundred years.](https://6sigma.com/major-contributors-to-the-theory-and-practice-of-process-improvement/)\n\nEli Whitney sped up manufacturing by introducing interchangeable parts. Frederick Taylor focused on analyzing factory tasks to boost productivity.\n\nLater, thought leaders such as Walter Shewhart, with his PDCA model, W. Edwards Deming, with his work on [quality control](https://www.sweetprocess.com/quality-control/), Taiichi Ohno, with [lean manufacturing](https://www.sweetprocess.com/lean-manufacturing/), Joseph Juran, and the creators of Six Sigma at Motorola helped shape process improvement into a formal approach.\n\nThese days, that mindset is built into modern software. Process improvement software are designed to help teams break down how work gets done, identify where things are going wrong, and implement smart changes that stick.\n\nThe best business process improvement tools make this easier by focusing on three core functions:\n\n### **1. Process Mapping**\n\nThis helps teams outline how tasks progress from start to finish. It reveals what’s working, what isn’t, and where delays or confusion are happening.\n\n### **2. Process Analysis**\n\nUse real data to spot bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and error-prone steps. This helps teams focus on the right problems rather than just assumptions.\n\n### **3. Process Optimization**\n\nOnce you spot the problems, you start improving. That might mean testing new steps, automating repetitive tasks, or [creating workflows](https://www.sweetprocess.com/workflow/) that scale easily. The goal is to build stronger systems instead of patching up broken ones.\n\n## **9 Best Process Improvement Software for Better Workflows**\n\n### **1. SweetProcess**\n\n[SweetProcess](https://www.sweetprocess.com/) is a tool built to help teams document and improve their day-to-day operations. It makes it easy to organize recurring tasks, [create step-by-step SOPs](https://www.sweetprocess.com/how-to-write-a-procedure/), and keep all your processes in one clear, accessible place.\n\nWhile some teams rely on internal wikis or general project management tools, SweetProcess is explicitly designed for [documenting workflows](https://www.sweetprocess.com/workflow-documentation/) and making them easier to understand, follow, and improve over time.\n\nIt’s a go-to solution for growing teams, remote companies, and operations managers who want to [speed up the onboarding process](https://www.sweetprocess.com/employee-onboarding/), prevent knowledge from getting lost, and bring consistency to how work gets done across different teams.\n\n#### **Core Features of SweetProcess**\n\nSweetProcess gives teams a straightforward yet powerful set of tools to bring more clarity and control to everyday operations:\n\n* Standard operating procedure (SOP) documentation\n* Process documentation\n* Policy management\n* Work instructions\n* Knowledge base\n* Task management\n* Cross-functional collaboration\n\n#### **How SweetProcess Speeds Up Process Improvement**\n\nLet’s be honest. Most teams don’t struggle because they lack talent. They struggle because no one knows the exact way things are supposed to get done.\n\nMaybe it’s an operations process that only one person understands. Or a recurring task that gets missed every time someone’s out sick. Or a handoff between two departments that always leads to “Wait, weren’t you supposed to do that?”\n\nThat’s where SweetProcess steps in.\n\nIt takes messy, undocumented workflows and turns them into clear, repeatable systems that anyone on the team can follow.\n\nLet’s break that down with a few real-world examples:\n\n**Onboarding a New Hire (HR Team)**\n\n**Before SweetProcess:**\n\nEach time someone joined, HR had to manually walk them through the setup. That meant sharing links over email, explaining policies from memory, and hoping managers remembered what to cover. If the HR lead was out, things fell through the cracks.\n\n**With SweetProcess:**\n\nWith SweetProcess, the HR builds a [step-by-step guide](https://www.sweetprocess.com/step-by-step-guide/) for onboarding with links, forms, documents, and even short videos.\n\nHere’s a guide in how this HR built this procedure:\n\n**1. You can log in & navigate to procedures in the home Page.**\n\nFrom the home page, click on the “More” Dropdown.\n\nThen you’ll find the “Procedure” at the top of the dropdown menu. Click on it.\n\n**2. Start a New Procedure**\n\nClick “Create Procedure” in the top-right corner.\n\n**3. Name It**\n\nEnter a clear, descriptive title e.g., “New Hire Onboarding”.\n\n**4. Choose Between Manual Creation or SweetAI**\n\nClick “Write with SweetAI” to auto-generate content with our [SweetProcess AI](https://www.sweetprocess.com/sweetprocess-ai/), or click “Continue” to build it manually.\n\n**5. Add the Steps**\n\nClick “Step” for each onboarding task.\n\nFor every step, add a title and details (including images, videos, tables, links as needed). Click “Finished Editing” when done.\n\n**6. Organize & Edit**\n\nRearrange, duplicate, or delete steps using the three-dot menu next to each one.\n\n**7. Approve to Publish**\n\nClick “Approve” at the top-right to make the procedure live (if you lack permission, choose “Request Approval” instead).\n\nOnce assigned, the new hire simply works through each step, checking them off as they go.\n\nManagers are looped in automatically when it’s their turn. And if a policy changes, HR just updates it once, and everyone sees the latest version.\n\n#### **Creating a Centralized Knowledge Base (Ops or IT Team)**\n\n**Before SweetProcess:**\n\nMost of the IT team’s know-how lived in someone’s head or scattered across Google Docs, no one remembered to update. When people left, so did their knowledge. New hires asked the same questions repeatedly, and basic answers turned into long Slack back-and-forths.\n\n**With SweetProcess:**\n\nNow, everything lives in one place. The IT team lead builds a searchable, easy-to-navigate knowledge base filled with step-by-step processes.\n\nHere’s how you can build a knowledge base just like this team lead:\n\n**1. Open the “More” Menu**\n\nFrom your SweetProcess dashboard, click More. This expands extra options (one of which is Knowledge Bases).\n\n**2. Go to “Knowledge Bases”**\n\nSelect Knowledge Bases to access the page where all your company’s knowledge bases live.\n\n**3. Start a New Knowledge Base**\n\nClick Create Knowledge Base to begin.\n\n**4. Give It a Name**\n\nType in a clear, descriptive title. For example, Operations Handbook or IT Help Center, then hit Continue.\n\n**5. Adjust the Settings**\n\nInside your new [knowledge base](https://www.sweetprocess.com/knowledge-base/), you can:\n\nChoose a theme so it looks clean and professional.\n\nDecide who can see it. Make it public for everyone or private for internal use only.\n\nEnable feedback so readers can share whether the content was useful.\n\n**6. Create Categories**\n\nBreak your knowledge base into sections. Click Create Category, name it, and save.\n\n**7. Add Your Content**\n\nClick Add New Article to insert content. Your [knowledge base articles](https://www.sweetprocess.com/how-to-write-a-knowledge-base-article/) must be based on procedures or policies you’ve already documented. Assign each one to the right category, and your knowledge base is ready to use.\n\nWhether it’s how to set up software, handle a task, or troubleshoot an issue, it’s all documented and up to date. Updates are instant, and everyone sees the latest version. So even if someone’s new, they don’t need to ask; they just look it up and get moving.\n\n#### **Systemizing Recurring Tasks (Ops, Admins, Team Leads)**\n\n**Before SweetProcess:**\n\nRecurring tasks were mostly based on memory. People knew what should be done: daily reports, weekly reviews, and monthly backups, but no one tracked them.\n\nDeadlines slipped. Things got skipped. And if the usual person wasn’t around, everything stalled.\n\n**With SweetProcess:**\n\nRecurring tasks are now part of a system. Each one is documented with clear steps, assigned to the right person, and scheduled to repeat.\n\nHere’s how to do that:\n\n1. From the top menu, open the “Tasks” tab.\n\nHit the “Assign Task” button in the upper right.\n\n2. Pick the procedure or process you want to turn into a task.\n\n3. Decide who gets it. You can assign it to a whole team, specific people, or even split individual steps between different members.\n\n4. Give the task a name, set the due date and time (and start time if you need one), then choose how often it should repeat for a repetitive task.\n\n5. Click Assign Task to make it official. It’ll appear in the Tasks list, where assignees can work through it and tick off each step as they go.\n\nYou can bundle related tasks into workflows and get notified when things are due or done. The team knows what needs to happen and when (even if someone’s out).\n\nTake [Benchmark Wealth Management](https://www.sweetprocess.com/how-benchmark-wealth-management-streamlined-its-operations-with-the-right-process-documentation-software/) for example. As a financial services firm, their onboarding process used to rely heavily on paper notebooks and verbal instructions. That system worked…until it didn’t.\n\nNew hires often received inconsistent guidance, and team members found themselves repeating answers to the same questions.\n\nProcedures weren’t always up to date, and when someone was unavailable, things came to a standstill.\n\nThat all changed when they adopted SweetProcess. Instead of scattered notes and ad hoc training, the team documented everything in one place.\n\nProcesses were written out in step-by-step detail, [providing new hires with a clear path](https://www.sweetprocess.com/new-hire-process/) to follow from day one. The need for constant hand-holding disappeared, and everyone could work more independently.\n\nReflecting on the impact, Elian Levatino, the certified financial planner (CFP®) and COO at Benchmark Wealth Management, said,\n\n> “Now, it’s become a bucket full of ideas rather than a bucket full of questions.”\n\nSarah, the branch operations manager at Benchmark Wealth Management, added,\n\n> “Our onboarding process is actually written down in SweetProcess. It walks us through the steps…before that person even walks in the door.”\n\n#### **SweetProcess Pricing**\n\nSweetProcess keeps things easy when it comes to pricing. For $99 a month, you get full access to all features for up to 20 active users. No confusing tiers. No locked features. Just one flat rate.\n\nIf your team exceeds 20 active users, the cost is $5 per additional user per month. This way, your cost scales based on how many people are actually using the platform.\n\nWhat makes our pricing stand out is the focus on active users. You only pay for people who log in and use the system, not for dormant accounts collecting dust. That’s a big win for you, teams that work with contractors or have seasonal staff.\n\n[**There’s also a 14-day free trial**](https://www.sweetprocess.com/accounts/signup/) so you can try everything before deciding to subscribe. No credit card required.   \n  \n Prefer to pay annually? You’ll save around 16% with our discounted yearly plan.\n\n### **2.

Multiple team members jump into the same diagram, edit together from different locations, and see changes live. It also connects seamlessly with tools many teams already use, such as Google Workspace, Slack, Atlassian products, and Microsoft 365.\n\n#### **Features of Lucidchart**\n\n* AI Diagram Generation: Instead of building diagrams manually, describe what you need in plain language and let Lucidchart generate it for you.

The Lean Way**\n\n#### **Overview of The Lean Way**\n\nThe Lean Way is a cloud-based continuous improvement (CI) and lean management platform.\n\nIt helps teams collect, track, and implement improvement ideas using [lean process improvement](https://www.sweetprocess.com/lean-process-improvement/). Employees submit suggestions or Kaizen projects through a shared workspace, and managers monitor progress in one place.\n\nA standout feature is its focus on knowledge sharing. Features like the Knowledge Wall allow users to post lessons learned, best practices, and insights so others across the organization can learn and benefit.\n\n#### **Features of The Lean Way**\n\n* Boards: Log and organize ideas using customizable private or public boards. Tag them by topic, team, or project so everyone finds and builds on them later.\n* Knowledge Wall: Display updates, status posts, and latest improvements in a live feed. Post updates, share wins, or highlight improvements in real time. Team members comment, like, and join the conversation to keep momentum going.\n* Widgets & Dashboards: Visualize progress using drag-and-drop widgets that show key metrics and trends. Track who’s doing what, how much impact your changes are having, and where things might be stuck.\n* Centralized Knowledge Base: Everything you log becomes searchable. That means no more reinventing the wheel. You’ll have a centralized, easy-to-navigate library of insights and improvements to pull from anytime.\n\n#### **The Lean Way Pricing**\n\nThe Lean Way offers a 14-day free trial, and you don’t need a credit card to get started. Pricing depends on the number of users. For example, one of the mid-tier plans, billed annually, comes in at around $599 per month for a team of about 100 users.\n\nSmaller team plans cover 25 or 50 users, while Enterprise options support over 1,000. If you choose annual billing, expect to save roughly 20%.\n\n## **Why Choose SweetProcess as Your Process Improvement Tool**\n\n### **Create SOPs, Policies, and Structured Workflows**\n\nSweetProcess lets you create everything from detailed [how-to guides](https://www.sweetprocess.com/how-to-guide/) to broader workflows and even full company policies.\n\nNot sure how those differ?

No more version confusion or endless email threads. Everyone stays on the same page with one clear source of truth.\n\n### **Version History and Edit Highlights**\n\nIf someone makes a mess, you’ll know who it was. Every change is tracked. View older versions, compare edits, and restore anything in a few clicks.\n\n### **User-Friendly UI Even for Non-Technical Teams**\n\nSweetProcess keeps things simple. It’s easy to use, even for teams that aren’t tech savvy. From operations managers to those in HR or customer support, anyone can jump in and build processes without additional training.\n\n**Ready to stop guessing and start scaling?**\n\n*If your team is still relying on scattered docs, tribal knowledge, or “this is how we’ve always done it,” it’s time to level up.*\n\nSweetProcess helps you document what matters, standardize how work gets done, and actually improve your processes, not just talk about them.   \n  \n [**Start your free 14-day trial now**](https://www.sweetprocess.com/accounts/signup/) and see how much smoother things run when everyone’s on the same page.\n\n## **Why Use a Process Improvement Tool?**\n\nImproving how work gets done isn’t just nice-to-have. It’s a must. Here’s what the right tool does for your team:\n\n### **Standardized Workflows and Procedures**\n\nNo more “I thought you were handling that.” A process tool ensures that everyone follows the same steps consistently. No guesswork. No reinventing the wheel.\n\n### **Lower Operational Costs**\n\nWhen your team isn’t wasting time figuring things out or fixing avoidable mistakes, you start to see real savings. [Streamlined processes](https://www.sweetprocess.com/streamline-processes/) enable better utilization of time, resources, and funds.\n\n### **Improved Team Efficiency**\n\nInstead of repeating tasks or constantly checking in for updates, your team stays focused on what matters. That means faster results and less back-and-forth.\n\n### **Fewer Mistakes and Defects**\n\nWhen everyone knows exactly what to do and how to do it, the risk of things going wrong drops dramatically. Clear instructions lead to fewer errors, whether it’s [onboarding a new hire](https://www.sweetprocess.com/onboarding-process/) or solving a customer issue.\n\n### **Improved Customer Satisfaction**\n\nSmooth internal processes show up in the customer experience too. Fast service, accurate information, and fewer delays leave a great impression and build trust.\n\n### **Enhanced Profitability**\n\nWhen you’re running leaner and delivering better, margins improve. It’s that simple.\n\n### **Drive Continuous Improvement Across Teams**\n\nThe right tool makes [continuous improvement](https://www.sweetprocess.com/continuous-improvement/) a habit and not a one-time fix. Teams test changes, track performance, and keep building better ways of working.\n\n## **Best Practices for Using a Process Improvement Software** In Your Business\n\nRolling out a process improvement tool is about setting it up for real impact. If you skip the groundwork, even the most promising platform ends up unused and forgotten. Here’s how to make sure it delivers results:\n\n### **Start With a High-Impact Process**\n\nResist the urge to overhaul everything at once. Choose one process that’s broken, overly manual, or draining your team’s time and energy. Fixing something that’s visibly painful gives you a quick win and builds momentum for tackling bigger challenges.\n\n### **Map Out Current vs. Ideal Workflows**\n\nYou can’t improve what you can’t see. Start by mapping how the process works today, then sketch out what a better version would look like. This makes it easier to pinpoint what’s slowing things down, what’s being repeated, or where things fall through the cracks.\n\n### **Involve Key Stakeholders**\n\nThe people doing the work every day have the best insight into what needs fixing. Talk to them—the managers, frontline workers, even clients, if needed. Their input keeps your improvements grounded in reality.\n\n### **Test, Optimize, and Scale**\n\nInstead of changing everything at once, test your updates on a small scale. See what works, gather feedback, make improvements, and then roll it out wider. This helps you avoid major disruptions and increases the chances that your team adopts the changes.\n\n### **Use Metrics to Measure Impact**\n\nBefore you launch, decide how you’ll track success. Whether it’s time saved, fewer mistakes, or faster turnaround, set those benchmarks early. If you don’t measure the impact, it’s hard to know if your new process is really making a difference.\n\n## **Which Process Improvement Tool Is Right for Your Company?**\n\nWe’ve just walked through nine tools, each designed to tackle [business process improvement](https://www.sweetprocess.com/business-process-improvement/) in its own way.\n\nSweetProcess is built for teams that need simple, [step-by-step procedures](https://www.sweetprocess.com/standard-operating-procedure/) and a shared knowledge hub. It’s ideal if you want to create consistency without getting bogged down in extra features you’ll never use.\n\nEach tool has its strengths. But if you want something easy to set up that helps you document and streamline how work gets done, or if you’re tired of wasting time reinventing the wheel every time someone joins your team or makes a mistake, give SweetProcess a try.\n\n[**Start your free 14-day trial today**](https://www.sweetprocess.com/accounts/signup/) and see how simple it is to document your processes, keep everyone aligned, and run your business without the guesswork.

envision roles, skills, and experiences of their workforce, as [generative AI transforms many jobs.](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/22/ai-taking-white-collar-jobs-economists-warn-much-more-in-the-tank.html)\n\n\"AI is reshaping the future of work by redistributing tasks within jobs.\"\n\nThose were the words of a U.S.-based chief human resources officer in response to a flash survey CNBC circulated last week among members of the [CNBC Workforce Executive Council](https://www.cnbccouncils.com/workforce-executive-council/), a collection of public and private company human resources leaders.\n\nWhen asked if AI is currently [having an impact on jobs](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/08/how-ai-is-poised-to-disrupt-the-job-market.html) at their firms, more than two-thirds (67%) of senior human resources executives polled in the CNBC survey said it is. The survey defined \"impact\" as having a significant portion of an employee's previous tasks automated or changing the way they work on a daily basis.\n\nAbout 50% of the 21 senior HR leaders who responded said AI impacted fewer than half of the jobs at their organizations. Meanwhile, 17%  said nearly half or more than half of the jobs were affected, and 11% reported being unsure. And, 22% said it has \"no impact\" on jobs at all.\n\n\"It is still too early to tell,\" said one HR leader in comments about the survey. \"Most organizations have not completely integrated AI tools into every job, nor have they identified ways to measure the impact.\"\n\nThat may change dramatically in the next 12 months, as 89% of the senior leaders surveyed say AI will impact jobs next year. About 45% said AI will impact nearly half or more than half of all jobs, and 44% said it will affect less than half of all jobs. About 11% said no jobs will be impacted.\n\nNearly two in five senior leaders (38%) said their firms will maintain current headcounts in the next 12 months. The number of HR leaders at firms that expect a headcount increase and those at firms that expect a headcount decrease was equal, at 29%.\n\nFor leaders planning to reduce their workforce over the next year, the \"general need to cut costs\" was the only reason cited by survey respondents, rather than inflation, tariffs, decreased demand, or efficiency gains from AI.\n\nThree out of five (61%) of the leaders in the CNBC survey stated that AI has made their company more efficient, while 39% said it's too early to tell.\n\nAnd 78% said AI has made their workforce more innovative, while 17% said AI has [not yet made a significant impact on their workforce.](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/07/generative-ai-knowledge-learning-jobs-education-skills-wharton-ethan-mollick.html)\n\nNew research shows that by reshaping work, AI could enhance innovation and increase efficiency, possibly leading to a shorter workweek. A new study from the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/news/ai-boosts-productivity-by-the-equivalent-of-one-workday-per-week-new-report-finds) finds that employees who use AI for work tasks save anaverage of 7.5 hours per week.\n\nRoughly 1 in 4 (or 26%) of the jobs posted on career site Indeed over the past year are [poised to \"radically transform\" due to](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/08/how-ai-is-poised-to-disrupt-the-job-market.html) AI, according to a September [report](https://www.hiringlab.org/2025/09/23/ai-at-work-report-2025-how-genai-is-rewiring-the-dna-of-jobs/) by Indeed.\n\nLearning how AI can augment human interactions is critical, senior HR leaders say.

Recent headlines accompanying layoff stories have been screaming about AI as the cause.\n\nBut layoffs may be happening with or without AI. “The AI apocalypse is probably not here just yet,” [wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/07/business/layoffs-ai-replacement.html) Noam Scheiber in The New York Times. “While the technology may have played an indirect role in some of the downsizing, experts say the transition to an AI-powered workplace most likely won’t entail large-scale layoffs in which employers dump humans in favor of machines. Rather, the transition is likely to be more gradual, in many cases occurring as new companies, built to exploit A.I., take market share from more established companies that are slower to embrace it.”\n\nIndeed, there is scant evidence AI-induced job displacement is happening at this time, a new [study](https://institute.bankofamerica.com/economic-insights/ai-impact-on-economy.html) from Bank of America Institute confirms.\n\nAI and technology-related investment has been a key driver of growth this year, but there is no evidence that it is affecting employment one way or another. BofA Global Research looked at the relationship between AI usage and employment growth, and “the correlation is weak.” There is evidence that white-collar sectors with higher AI adoption – such as finance and professional services – are seeing stronger productivity gains.\n\nBofA’s observations are based on U.S. Census data from bi-weekly surveys of businesses’ use of AI within the two seeks prior to the survey. (The current data came in before the October 1st government shutdown.)\n\nWhen comparing AI usage levels to year-to-date employment changes in major industries, there is a slightly negative correlation between higher AI usage and employment growth – emphasis on “slightly,” the researchers emphasized. Any correlation with weaker employment growth “could have happened by random chance and higher AI usage is possibly unrelated for now,” the study’s authors stated.\n\nThe BofA researchers concluded that AI is “more of a capex driver than a job destroyer – at least so far.” So, spending on AI and technology keeps ramping upward, “the impact on the labor market is less clear.” Other trends, including increased economic uncertainty, may have led to less hiring overall, they noted.\n\n\"When zooming in on white-collar industries – information, professional and business services, finance and insurance, and real estate – and looking at year-to-date change in AI usage versus employment, BofA Global Research finds a relatively strong positive relationship between the two, at least for now – those with increased AI use report higher levels of employment as well.\n\nFor the most part, the findings “suggest that AI is playing out mostly as a productivity story for white-collar workers.” The researchers add caveats to the findings, including a relatively small sample size, and the possibility that “firms may adopt a different strategy if an economic downturn were to happen, with AI allowing for larger layoffs as opposed to job gains amid resilient growth.”\n\nThe bottom line is we may be witnessing “an employment paradox of AI,” wrote Stuart Winter-Tear, industry analyst and author, in an [analysis](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/stuart-winter-tear_economic-shifts-in-the-age-of-ai-activity-7390318880679743488-OQx0) of the BofA report in LinkedIn. While the simplistic view has been that AI was threatening to usurp white-collar work, the BofA data “suggests something more complex,\" he pointed out.\n\n“The aggregate effect is still small and statistically uncertain, but the direction is notable,” he continued. \"It hints at early redistribution and complementarity, not broad displacement. “In white-collar sectors such as information, finance, and professional services, the relationship turns positive and relatively strong for now. Longer-term projections also resist simple automation stories: roles like software developers and financial advisors are still expected to grow.”\n\nThese days, “roles that frame, verify, and explain,” may have the brightest future with AI, Winter-Tear predicted. “Developers look less like coders and more like system conductors, composing services and managing feedback loops. Advisors and analysts move from information provision to interpretation under constraint. Trust, judgment, and synthesis remain the premium that AI cannot reach.”\n\n[Editorial Standards](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesstaff/article/forbes-editorial-values-and-standards/)[Reprints & Permissions](https://www.parsintl.com/publications/forbes/)"

But while such concerns are real, so is the opportunity. The same report also states that AI will create 170 million new jobs.\n\nWe are at a critical juncture where AI can either amplify or erode humanity’s most defining trait: our cognitive abilities. Creativity, contextual reasoning and ethical judgment are capabilities that no algorithm can fully replicate. Guided development of AI, shaped by social scientists, ethicists and educators, will preserve and amplify these strengths rather than diminish them.\n\nBy embracing physical AI and a net-positive AI framework within a transdisciplinary educational setting, future workforces can prepare for the AI-native, autonomous and ethically aligned economy of the future.\n\n##### Have you read?\n\n* ##### [How AI’s impact on value creation, jobs and productivity is coming into focus](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/how-ai-impacts-value-creation-jobs-and-productivity-is-coming-into-focus/)\n* ##### [How to leverage your skills in the post-knowledge AI economy](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/04/how-to-leverage-skills-in-post-knowledge-ai-economy/)\n* ##### [Future of jobs: 5 ways to match skills to more meaningful work](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/03/jobs-match-meaningful-work-technology/)\n\n## **Workforce transitions across decades**\n\nEvery era has had a particular skill that assured employability. Disruptive technological advances such as computers and word processors rendered millions of jobs irrelevant, but they also created new opportunities. This pattern repeats with each major new technology.\n\nIn the telecom-centric workforce of the 1970s, for example, manual telephony operators and analog engineers dominated, while software developers were scarce and media production relied on large crews and physical distribution networks.\n\nAs the digital era emerged starting in the 1980s and 1990s, digital switching reduced manual telephone operators and personal computers created new jobs such as IT support and software programming. Mobile telephony introduced more new jobs and was followed by the rise of mass media in the 1990s and 2000s, which saw a proliferation of mass market cellular devices and personal computers in homes and businesses.\n\nThe internet and early mobile broadband triggered an explosion in software development and IT services between 2000 and 2010. While legacy service roles declined, e-commerce and digital advertising took off. In the 2010s, cloud computing, smartphones and 4G/5G created demand for DevOps, cloud architects and mobile developers. The first wave of machine learning (ML) engineers and data scientists was also increasingly in demand among businesses.\n\nIn the 2020s, AI copilots, low-code platforms and data-driven analytics have begun to automate repetitive coding. Data scientists and AI engineering roles have grown, with coding shifting toward higher-level integration and orchestration. By 2030, we can expect to be in the AI-native and autonomy era. Today’s baseline workforce, composed largely of general-purpose software developers, data analysts and IT support professionals, will likely face fundamental disruptions as routine coding and traditional IT tasks become fully automated.\n\nAI systems are already on course to autonomously generate, test and deploy solutions, reducing repetitive human tasks. But this disruption will unlock new opportunities. The demand for roles that combine domain-specific expertise with AI literacy – including AI system architects, ethics and governance specialists, human-AI collaboration designers, and physical AI specialists working in robotics and autonomous mobility – will significantly increase.\n\nMoreover, new industries built around AI-driven physical systems and AI-augmented decision-making are likely to emerge, creating new types of jobs and economic growth in untapped areas.\n\n## **Three visions of an AI future**\n\nThe digital telecom revolution blended electronics, computing and network theory. The internet era fused computer networking with mobile communications, application development, software engineering, economics and user experience.\n\nToday, the AI/ML surge is exploiting the synergies among semiconductor technologies, physical sciences, life sciences and statistics. Looking forward, the confluence of three visions will likely disrupt future workforces once again:\n\n### 1. Physical AI as a workforce skill\n\nNvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang believes that [physical AI](https://www.youtube.com/live/X9cHONwKkn4?si=VAmmw6IjM4TocxpP) – tools that use real-time data from sensors like cameras to complex more complex tasks – will become a vital future workforce skill. AI is evolving from perception and generative models to agentic and physical AI, where robots, drones and autonomous vehicles must master dynamics via physics-accurate simulations, real-time control and materials science.\n\n### 2. A net-positive AI framework\n\nProfessor John Hennessy, past president of Stanford University, argues that [a net-positive framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02730) is key to AI benefiting billions of people. This requires ethics-by-design, public-good research funding and cross-disciplinary collaboration that bridges technical and societal dimensions.\n\n### 3. A transdisciplinary, systems engineering mindset\n\nAn overarching [transdisciplinary systems thinking](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3233/JID-2007-11101?download=true) and [systems engineering mindset](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-62184-5) will break down silos between life sciences, physical sciences, material sciences, engineering and computation, spurring even more innovation.\n\nThe [National Academies’ convergence report](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/18722/convergence-facilitating-transdisciplinary-integration-of-life-sciences-physical-sciences-engineering), published in 2014, made recommendations on this issue that remain valid today. These include a curricular overhaul with project-based modules that fuse physics, materials, computation and engineering. Alongside this, convergence hubs should promote team-based breakthroughs and challenge-driven learning should embed students in real-world problem-solving.\n\nLoading...\n\n## **A multi-skill approach for future workforces**\n\nIn the next decade, workforce success will not be defined by a single skill like typing in the 1980s or coding in the 2000s, but by the ability to integrate across disciplines and work with AI systems.\n\nWhether its AI literacy providing the ability to understand and work with AI copilots, or data fluency helping people to interpret and communicate using data, domain expertise will be enhanced by digital capabilities in sectors from healthcare and finance to advanced manufacturing. Cognitive resilience and ethics awareness will also give people a creative edge through the use of critical thinking capabilities and moral reasoning when collaborating with AI.\n\nA transdisciplinary systems mindset in education is essential to create a pipeline of graduates with these key skills. Educational strategies that will help to realize this vision include convergent labs devoted to co-teaching basic physical sciences, AI and engineering, as well as mission-driven research centres to sustain innovation. Transdisciplinary capstone projects should also bring together students from diverse backgrounds to solve complex real-world problems with ethics-awareness\n\nAs new technologies continue to emerge, the future will belong to those who can build and contribute to AI systems that not only exhibit intelligent behaviour but also respect and enhance human cognitive abilities.\n\n[*Professor Harald Haas*](https://www.weforum.org/stories/authors/harald-haas/)*, TITAN Hub, University of Cambridge, also contributed to this article.*\n\n##### Don't miss any update on this topic\n\nCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.\n\n[Sign up for free](/join-us/individuals)\n\nLicense and Republishing\n\nWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.\n\n##### Stay up to date:\n\n#### Artificial Intelligence\n\n##### Related topics:\n\n[Jobs and the Future of Work](https://www.weforum.org/stories/jobs-and-the-future-of-work/)[Education and Skills](https://www.weforum.org/stories/education-and-skills/)[Emerging Technologies](https://www.weforum.org/stories/emerging-technologies/)[Business](https://www.weforum.org/stories/business/)\n\n##### Share:\n\n[The Big Picture\n\n##### Explore and monitor how Artificial Intelligence is affecting economies, industries and global issues](https://intelligence.weforum.org/topics/a1Gb0000000pTDREA2?tab=publications)\n\n## Forum Storiesnewsletter\n\nBringing you weekly curated insights and analysis on the global issues that matter.\n\n[Subscribe today](https://pub.s6.exacttarget.com/u1toxyddesm)\n\n### More on Jobs and the Future of Work [See all](https://www.weforum.org/stories/jobs-and-the-future-of-work/)\n\n[How Nigeria’s youthful population could help it become a digital talent powerhouse](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/11/nigeria-youth-wave-skills-powerhouse/)\n\nJumoke Oduwole and Abir Ibrahim\n\nNovember 11, 2025\n\n[How CEOs and CIOs can lead the AI transformation together](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/11/how-ceos-and-cios-can-lead-the-ai-transformation-together/)\n\n[The economics of empathy: why human connection is the future of business](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/11/empathy-business-return-on-investment-new-study/)\n\n[How Africa’s energy transition can break the resource curse](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/11/africa-energy-transition-resource-curse/)\n\n[Beyond efficiency: Why business must build resilient human-AI partnerships](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/10/ai-business-efficiency-resilience/)\n\n[How to build ocean industries that heal, not harm](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/10/how-to-build-ocean-industries-that-heal-not-harm/)"

At the Penn Wharton Budget Model, we've examined how AI can impact economic growth, future deficits, and the finances of a large program like Social Security. While we model AI as more labor-augmenting than labor-replacing based on past innovations, a legitimate question is why we don't focus more on specific labor market outcomes, including job losses by exposed sector and the impact on wages across the income distribution. The reason is simple: the current data really do not yet support a clear labor-market conclusion on their own. We first need better theoretical modeling and more experience with AI. That assessment might be surprising to people who are lining up on both sides of this issue. On one hand, you might have seen a graph that shows how job postings suddenly fell after ChatGPT-3 was introduced. Plus, layoffs at Amazon and other technology companies are also making waves. But that evidence is not very useful. A lot of that change has nothing to do with AI. Many companies are laying off workers in response to macroeconomic outcomes and COVID hiring. Companies naturally want to project gains from AI to their investors, but other factors are more important. On the other hand, some recent studies have appeared to show little impact of AI on employment, often using variation in reported AI use by sector. Some tech companies love that message because it makes them seem less villainous. But much of that evidence already selects in favor of labor-augmenting change rather than labor replacing (survivor bias). For example, call centers that remain are not using nearly as much AI as those previously replaced by AI for a reason. The truth is that data—even a lot of it—cannot be interpreted without serious theoretical modeling that helps us construct the right tests and interpret the results. In fact, the very fact that macro effects seem to be contaminating micro conclusions should give some pause: the analysis is likely poorly identified. The good news is that stronger theoretical work is now being done that is laying the foundations for future empirical work.

Historically, technology disrupters have gained the United States jobs, although impacting sectors of work. The automation of farm work is a good example, but the closest analogy to LLM and algorithm automation is probably the invention of the personal computer.

This newsletter explores AI's multifaceted impact, from its evolving influence on employment across different generations to its transformative power in retail and enterprise operations. We will examine how AI is simultaneously creating new efficiencies and raising important questions about the future of work. Navigating the AI Impact on Employment: A Current Perspective The swift progress of AI is fueling discussions about its potential effects on employment, particularly among younger generations. A recent Deutsche Bank Research survey found that nearly one in five Gen Z workers are \"very concerned\" about AI displacing their jobs within the next two years. In contrast, only about one in ten Baby Boomers and Gen Xers (aged 55 and above) share this anxiety Fortune. This disparity may be due to entry-level positions often being more vulnerable to automation, while experienced workers tend to hold more specialized roles Fortune. While figures like Geoffrey Hinton, often called the \"Godfather of AI,\" predict a \"massive spike in unemployment\" that will enrich a few and impoverish many Yahoo Finance, current data in the United States offers a more nuanced view. A study by The Budget Lab at Yale, analyzing labor market changes since ChatGPT's release 33 months ago, found \"no discernible disruption\" directly attributable to AI. They conclude that fears of an \"AI jobs apocalypse\" are not currently supported by widespread job displacement CNN. Other research also highlights the slow pace of widespread AI adoption, often due to practical challenges like privacy concerns, liability risks, and the need for significant cultural and workflow adjustments within organizations Brookings Institution. However, some economists are observing a trend toward \"jobless growth,\" where AI boosts productivity and economic output without a corresponding increase in employment. Goldman Sachs analysts noted that job growth outside of healthcare recently turned negative, with corporate management increasingly using AI to cut labor costs, potentially impacting long-term hiring Business Insider. They suggest that while overall labor market disruption is currently modest, AI appears to be \"hurting the employment prospects of the most closely exposed workers, such as young technology workers\" Business Insider. Despite these differing outlooks, there is a consensus on the need for proactive adaptation. Employees are increasingly engaging in \"shadow AI economy\" practices, using AI tools in secret, which indicates a strong desire for self-education and skill development Fortune. This underscores the critical need for companies to offer robust AI training programs, which remain limited in both Europe and the U.S. Fortune. Furthermore, some workers concerned about jo...\n\n[![Image 14](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kentsmetters_what-is-the-impact-of-ai-on-labor-markets-activity-7390508485312151554-sPcr) 1](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fadam-aljahdhami-550586218_as-of-10-18-2025-artificial-intelligence-activity-7385272363384332288-EjD8&trk=public_post_social-actions-reactions)\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fadam-aljahdhami-550586218_as-of-10-18-2025-artificial-intelligence-activity-7385272363384332288-EjD8&trk=public_post_like-cta)[Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fadam-aljahdhami-550586218_as-of-10-18-2025-artificial-intelligence-activity-7385272363384332288-EjD8&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\n\n Share \n    *   Copy\n    *   LinkedIn\n    *   Facebook\n    *   X\n\nTo view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fadam-aljahdhami-550586218_as-of-10-18-2025-artificial-intelligence-activity-7385272363384332288-EjD8&trk=public_post_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n\n*   \n[](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/adam-aljahdhami-550586218_as-of-october-19-2025-artificial-activity-7385872608245944320-nlFK)\n\n[![Image 15: View profile for Adam Aljahdhami](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kentsmetters_what-is-the-impact-of-ai-on-labor-markets-activity-7390508485312151554-sPcr)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-aljahdhami-550586218?trk=public_post_feed-actor-image)[Adam Aljahdhami](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-aljahdhami-550586218?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name) \n--\n\n 3w    \n\n    *   [Report this post](https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fadam-aljahdhami-550586218_as-of-october-19-2025-artificial-activity-7385872608245944320-nlFK&trk=public_post_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\n\nAs of October 19, 2025, Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to reshape industries at an unprecedented pace. This edition explores AI's multifaceted impact, from its influence on employment and the evolving landscape of advertising to its transformative power in the retail sector. We delve into emerging concerns, ethical considerations, and the innovative opportunities AI presents for a forward-thinking business environment. The Evolving Landscape of AI and Employment: A Deeper Look at Job Displacement Concerns The integration of AI into the workplace has sparked considerable debate regarding its potential impact on job security, revealing a generational divide in apprehension levels. A Deutsche Bank Research survey indicates that nearly one in five Gen Z workers is \"very concerned\" about AI displacing their jobs within the next two years, a stark contrast to the approximately 10% of Baby Boomers and Gen Xers (aged 55 and above) who share similar anxieties Source. This concern among younger generations is supported by research from institutions like Stanford and Harvard, which highlights a decline in junior-level employment in AI-embracing sectors such as software engineering and customer service, while senior roles remain stable or have expanded. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that unemployment among recent graduates, at 4.8%, now exceeds the national average for all workers Source. Goldman Sachs analysts further note that AI appears to be negatively impacting the employment prospects of junior technology workers Source. Despite these anxieties, the broader economic impact is complex. A study from The Budget Lab at Yale University suggests no \"discernible disruption\" in the overall labor market since ChatGPT's release 33 months ago, tempering fears that AI is significantly eroding demand for cognitive labor across the economy Source. However, researchers caution that AI adoption is still in its early stages Source. Concerns about technology displacing jobs are not new, dating back to the Industrial Revolution Source. Yet, the current AI wave presents a unique challenge due to its speed, scale, and evolving capabilities Source. A critical issue is the inadequacy of current training efforts; only a quarter of European and a third of U.S. respondents in the Deutsche Bank study reported receiving AI training from employers Source. This pushes some employees into a \"shadow AI economy,\" using AI tools covertly to fill skill gaps Source. The potential for \"jobless growth,\" where AI drives economic output without a proportional increase in employment, is also a significant concern. Goldman Sachs warns that the recent trend of modest job growth alongside robust GDP growth could become the norm as companies leverage AI to reduce labor costs Source. Addressing these challenges requires enhanced training, strategic business a...\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fadam-aljahdhami-550586218_as-of-october-19-2025-artificial-activity-7385872608245944320-nlFK&trk=public_post_like-cta)[Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fadam-aljahdhami-550586218_as-of-october-19-2025-artificial-activity-7385872608245944320-nlFK&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\n\n Share \n    *   Copy\n    *   LinkedIn\n    *   Facebook\n    *   X\n\nTo view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fadam-aljahdhami-550586218_as-of-october-19-2025-artificial-activity-7385872608245944320-nlFK&trk=public_post_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n\n*   \n[](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/adam-aljahdhami-550586218_as-of-october-21-2025-artificial-intelligence-activity-7386355931787399168-TyGn)\n\n[![Image 16: View profile for Adam Aljahdhami](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kentsmetters_what-is-the-impact-of-ai-on-labor-markets-activity-7390508485312151554-sPcr)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-aljahdhami-550586218?trk=public_post_feed-actor-image)[Adam Aljahdhami](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-aljahdhami-550586218?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name) \n--\n\n 3w    \n\n    *   [Report this post](https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fadam-aljahdhami-550586218_as-of-october-21-2025-artificial-intelligence-activity-7386355931787399168-TyGn&trk=public_post_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\n\nAs of October 21, 2025, Artificial Intelligence continues to reshape the business landscape, prompting both excitement and apprehension. From redefining the job market to revolutionizing ad measurement and streamlining daily operations, AI's omnipresence demands our attention and strategic adaptation. This newsletter explores the multifaceted impact of AI across these critical domains, offering insights into its current trajectory and future implications for businesses and professionals alike. Understanding AI's Impact on the Job Market: A Nuanced Perspective The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has ignited extensive debate regarding its potential effects on employment, encompassing concerns about widespread job displacement and the emergence of new career opportunities. While anxieties are particularly prevalent among younger generations, recent studies present a more intricate picture. A Deutsche Bank Research survey indicates that nearly one in five Gen Z workers (aged 18-34) are \"very concerned\" that AI will displace their jobs within two years. This contrasts significantly with older workers (55 and above), where approximately 10% express similar fears. This generational divergence may stem from younger workers frequently occupying entry-level positions that are more susceptible to automation. Studies from Stanford and Harvard support this, showing a decline in junior employment in AI-impacted sectors like software engineering and customer service, while senior roles remain stable or expand. Goldman Sachs further cautions about \"jobless growth,\" where AI boosts economic output without necessarily creating jobs, noting that job growth outside healthcare has turned negative and corporate focus on AI to reduce labor costs could affect long-term hiring [Business Insider]. Analysts at the bank also highlighted that AI appears to be particularly affecting \"young technology workers\" [Business Insider]. However, other research suggests that fears of a widespread \"AI jobs apocalypse\" might be premature. A Yale University study, published by The Budget Lab, found \"no sign\" of AI causing mass unemployment since ChatGPT's introduction in November 2022. Their analysis indicated that the overall labor market has not experienced a \"discernible disruption,\" mitigating concerns about AI \"eroding the demand for cognitive labor across the economy\" [Diginomica & CNN]. The study emphasizes that significant technological shifts typically evolve over decades, not months, and much of the recorded change in occupational mix predates the advent of generative AI [Diginomica]. The impact of AI also varies by geography and sector. Americans generally show higher anxiety and AI usage in the workplace compared to their European counterparts. Within industries, sectors such as Information, Financial Activities, and Professional and Business Services have experienced ...\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fadam-aljahdhami-550586218_as-of-october-21-2025-artificial-intelligence-activity-7386355931787399168-TyGn&trk=public_post_like-cta)[Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fadam-aljahdhami-550586218_as-of-october-21-2025-artificial-intelligence-activity-7386355931787399168-TyGn&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\n\n Share \n    *   Copy\n    *   LinkedIn\n    *   Facebook\n    *   X\n\nTo view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fadam-aljahdhami-550586218_as-of-october-21-2025-artificial-intelligence-activity-7386355931787399168-TyGn&trk=public_post_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n\n*   \n[](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wensley_nine-years-ago-tomorrow-i-decided-to-go-activity-7390558538055499776-x6Xq)\n\n[![Image 17: View profile for Stephen Wensley](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kentsmetters_what-is-the-impact-of-ai-on-labor-markets-activity-7390508485312151554-sPcr)](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/wensley?trk=public_post_feed-actor-image)[Stephen Wensley](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/wensley?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name) \nCall me @ 587-317-6080 - Founder of Acuspire.ai - Giving A.I. superpowers to employment organizations! 💪\n\n 1w    \n\n    *   [Report this post](https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fwensley_nine-years-ago-tomorrow-i-decided-to-go-activity-7390558538055499776-x6Xq&trk=public_post_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\n\nNine years ago tomorrow, I decided to go all-in on AI. This was far more intense than I expected. The main area of interest for me was the potential impacts on the job market as AI and automation started to transform the workforce. By nature, I'm an optimist, but I spent years pushing through AI hesitancy and skepticism. From 2017-2019, multiple VPs and Directors of HR told me point-blank: \"We're not interested in technology that eliminates jobs.\" People laughed when I suggested AI would create MORE demand for skilled workers, not less. Contrary to popular thought-leaders, I believed that AI would make workers MORE efficient and INCREASE demand for their labor, rather than decreasing it. The conviction I felt meant that there was nothing else I could look at opportunity-wise; this was it. I believed there would be a rebound effect as new jobs would be created, new innovations sparked, and huge acceleration of company growth. There's actually an economic theory to back this up. It's called Jevons' paradox. There are countless examples of where increased efficiencies or decreased costs for a resource increased demand. Here's where the data is now showing this play out: 1️⃣ AI Skills Wage Premium: The wage premium for workers with AI skills has more than doubled from 25% to 56% in the last year (LinkedIn Economic Graph). This demonstrates an accelerating demand for AI-proficient talent. 2️⃣ Company Growth Metrics: Companies that are AI-adopting \"leaders\" are outperforming their peers, achieving 1.5 times higher revenue growth and seeing 3x higher growth in revenue per worker in AI-exposed industries (BCG, 2024). 3️⃣ AI Infrastructure Jobs: Physical demands of AI are creating a critical labor shortage in skilled trades. The US is projected to face a deficit of 140,000 electricians, HVAC technicians, and other skilled trades by 2030 to meet the needs of new AI data centers (Associated Builders and Contractors). Side note: I could not yet find data for Canada. We're in the early stages of a new industrial revolution. Instead of coal and steam-powered factories, we have \"AI factories\" in large-scale data centers. We're manufacturing intelligence instead of physical products. Decision-makers who understand long-term impacts and benefits of AI aren't interested in reducing headcounts for skilled roles. They're actually hitting the gas harder and expanding their teams as quickly as they can to catch a competitive opportunity window before it closes! But here's the uncomfortable part I need to be honest about: This isn't benefiting everyone equally. The main increases in demand for human labor are going to be for the people already capable of using the latest AI technologies or able to learn quickly. If you're waiting for \"the dust to settle\" before going AI-native, you're not being cautious, you're falling behind a wage gap that's doubling year-over-year. The window is open right now. But it won't stay open forever. What's your move?\n\n    *   ![Image 18: No alternative text description for this image](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kentsmetters_what-is-the-impact-of-ai-on-labor-markets-activity-7390508485312151554-sPcr)\n\n[![Image 19](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kentsmetters_what-is-the-impact-of-ai-on-labor-markets-activity-7390508485312151554-sPcr)![Image 20](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kentsmetters_what-is-the-impact-of-ai-on-labor-markets-activity-7390508485312151554-sPcr)![Image 21](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kentsmetters_what-is-the-impact-of-ai-on-labor-markets-activity-7390508485312151554-sPcr) 24](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fwensley_nine-years-ago-tomorrow-i-decided-to-go-activity-7390558538055499776-x6Xq&trk=public_post_social-actions-reactions)[3 Comments](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fwensley_nine-years-ago-tomorrow-i-decided-to-go-activity-7390558538055499776-x6Xq&trk=public_post_social-actions-comments)\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fwensley_nine-years-ago-tomorrow-i-decided-to-go-activity-7390558538055499776-x6Xq&trk=public_post_like-cta)[Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fwensley_nine-years-ago-tomorrow-i-decided-to-go-activity-7390558538055499776-x6Xq&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\n\n Share \n    *   Copy\n    *   LinkedIn\n    *   Facebook\n    *   X\n\nTo view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fwensley_nine-years-ago-tomorrow-i-decided-to-go-activity-7390558538055499776-x6Xq&trk=public_post_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n\n*   \n[](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/isabella-frigo_ai-is-making-jobs-not-taking-them-activity-7387742287549763584-rlGP)\n\n[![Image 22: View profile for Isabella Frigo](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kentsmetters_what-is-the-impact-of-ai-on-labor-markets-activity-7390508485312151554-sPcr)](https://it.linkedin.com/in/isabella-frigo?trk=public_post_feed-actor-image)[Isabella Frigo](https://it.linkedin.com/in/isabella-frigo?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name) \nAI Governance and Ethics\n\n 2w  Edited    \n\n    *   [Report this post](https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fisabella-frigo_ai-is-making-jobs-not-taking-them-activity-7387742287549763584-rlGP&trk=public_post_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\n\n🚨 The recent commentary by [RAND](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rand-corporation?trk=public_post-text) (October 24, 2025) , originally published by Barron’s on October 18, and authored by [Jonathan Welburn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-welburn-093b2915?trk=public_post-text) and [Vegard Mokleiv Nygaard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vegardmokleivnygaard?trk=public_post-text), invites us to radically reconsider the way we interpret the relationship between artificial intelligence and work. The title is provocative: “AI is making jobs, not taking them”, but the content goes beyond optimism: it offers a data-driven, more cautious and realistic perspective on what is actually happening. The starting point is clear: AI is not (yet) revolutionizing employment the way Wall Street and the media suggest and the real issue lies in how slowly AI is being adopted in real business processes. 🔍 Some interesting data: * Only 2 % of companies in the logistics and transportation sector use generative AI. * In the financial and insurance sectors, the rate is around 10 %. * Even in the IT world, only 1 in 4 companies truly integrates generative AI into its products or services. But the most surprising data point is this: companies that use AI are more likely to increase employment than reduce it. Why? Because we’re confusing “exposure to AI” with “full automation.” Most AI technologies today are augmenting and redefining work, not replacing it. 💡 Another study cited in the piece ([MIT Sloan Executive Education](https://www.linkedin.com/school/mit-sloan-executive-education/?trk=public_post-text)) shows that 95 % of companies are not getting returns from their AI investments because they still fail to integrate these tools into their core processes. The problem isn’t technological power, but alignment between tools, people and organizational structure. 📎 At least three reflections emerge for those working in governance and labor markets: 1. Talking about AI without considering real adoption data creates false expectations and unnecessary polarization. 2. Regulating the future of work can’t be based on rigid categories (“human” vs “artificial” labor), but on hybrid ecosystems. 3. This is the time to invest in training and adaptive capacity, not in apocalyptic predictions. 📣 The real issue isn’t “AI vs work,” but rather AI as a catalyst for new types of work and new skills. 👉 Read the full RAND commentary: [https://lnkd.in/dVzV2bCb](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FdVzV2bCb&urlhash=m7XR&trk=public_post-text)[#AIGovernance](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Faigovernance&trk=public_post-text)[#JobCreation](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fjobcreation&trk=public_post-text)[#AIAdoption](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Faiadoption&trk=public_post-text)[#Ethics](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fethics&trk=public_post-text) # [#AIWorkforce](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Faiworkforce&trk=public_post-text)[#DigitalTransformation](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdigitaltransformation&trk=public_post-text)\n\n[![Image 23: AI Is Making Jobs, not Taking Them](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kentsmetters_what-is-the-impact-of-ai-on-labor-markets-activity-7390508485312151554-sPcr) AI Is Making Jobs, not Taking Them rand.org](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Erand%2Eorg%2Fpubs%2Fcommentary%2F2025%2F10%2Fai-is-making-jobs-not-taking-them%2Ehtml&urlhash=tV-r&trk=public_post_feed-article-content)\n\n[![Image 24](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kentsmetters_what-is-the-impact-of-ai-on-labor-markets-activity-7390508485312151554-sPcr)![Image 25](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kentsmetters_what-is-the-impact-of-ai-on-labor-markets-activity-7390508485312151554-sPcr)![Image 26](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kentsmetters_what-is-the-impact-of-ai-on-labor-markets-activity-7390508485312151554-sPcr) 22](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fisabella-frigo_ai-is-making-jobs-not-taking-them-activity-7387742287549763584-rlGP&trk=public_post_social-actions-reactions)\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fisabella-frigo_ai-is-making-jobs-not-taking-them-activity-7387742287549763584-rlGP&trk=public_post_like-cta)[Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fisabella-frigo_ai-is-making-jobs-not-taking-them-activity-7387742287549763584-rlGP&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\n\n Share \n    *   Copy\n    *   LinkedIn\n    *   Facebook\n    *   X\n\nTo view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fisabella-frigo_ai-is-making-jobs-not-taking-them-activity-7387742287549763584-rlGP&trk=public_post_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n\n*   \n[](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mit-sloan-school-of-management_how-artificial-intelligence-impacts-the-us-activity-7384197608027684864-bRf-)\n\n[![Image 27: View organization page for MIT Sloan School of Management](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kentsmetters_what-is-the-impact-of-ai-on-labor-markets-activity-7390508485312151554-sPcr)](https://www.linkedin.com/school/mit-sloan-school-of-management/?trk=public_post_feed-actor-image)[MIT Sloan School of Management](https://www.linkedin.com/school/mit-sloan-school-of-management/?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name) \n601,873 followers\n\n 1mo    \n\n    *   [Report this post](https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fmit-sloan-school-of-management_how-artificial-intelligence-impacts-the-us-activity-7384197608027684864-bRf-&trk=public_post_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\n\nA new study co-authored by MIT Sloan associate professor Lawrence Schmidt found that firms using AI extensively tend to be larger and more productive, and pay higher wages.

That will get better everyday but for now it is the reality of being on the cutting edge of AI in business.

As companies deploy smarter and faster tools, workers are able to amplify output and productivity in ways previous technologies couldn’t match. The wave of AI adoption is reshaping structural aspects of the economy, investment patterns, industry dominance, and labour-market mechanics are all shifting under the weight of new capabilities. While some fear automation will displace jobs, the more nuanced reality shows AI not simply replacing labour but transforming it: tasks once performed manually are now managed or supervised by AI, freeing workers to focus on higher-value work. At the same time, structural changes are unfolding: sectors anchored in traditional labour-intensive processes are evolving, infrastructure is adapting, and the overall growth model of the U.S. economy is transforming. With AI writing the next chapter of growth, the key question isn’t just if the economy will expand, but how and for whom. As firms invest heavily in performance, data centres, and AI platforms, and as new tools enable writing smarter and faster, we’re moving toward an economy where scale and speed matter more than ever. In this environment, stakeholders, from investors and business leaders to policymakers, must navigate not only waves of innovation but also the structural impacts that are shaping today’s economy, such as shifts in skills demand, capital intensity, and the balance between human and machine labour. The outcome: a U.S. economy poised for a distinctive AI-led growth phase, one defined by increased performance, structural reconfiguration, and evolving opportunities for value creation.
